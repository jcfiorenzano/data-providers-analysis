Git uses external ""credential helper"" programs to store and retrieve passwords or other credentials from secure storage provided by the operating system. Specially-crafted URLs that contain an encoded newline can inject unintended values into the credential helper protocol stream, causing the credential helper to retrieve the password for one server (e.g., good.example.com) for an HTTP request being made to another server (e.g., evil.example.com), resulting in credentials for the former being sent to the latter. There are no restrictions on the relationship between the two, meaning that an attacker can craft a URL that will present stored credentials for any host to a host of their choosing. The vulnerability can be triggered by feeding a malicious URL to git clone.

6393,36522,17774,234232,"Affected versions of Git have a vulnerability whereby Git can be tricked into sending private credentials to a host controlled by an attacker. This bug is similar to CVE-2020-5260(GHSA-qm7j-c969-7j4q). The fix for that bug still left the door open for an exploit where _some_ credential is leaked (but the attacker cannot control which one). Git uses external ""credential helper"" programs to store and retrieve passwords or other credentials from secure storage provided by the operating system. Specially-crafted URLs that are considered illegal as of the recently published Git versions can cause Git to send a ""blank"" pattern to helpers, missing hostname and protocol fields. Many helpers will interpret this as matching _any_ URL, and will return some unspecified stored password, leaking the password to an attacker's server. The vulnerability can be triggered by feeding a malicious URL to `git clone`. However, the affected URLs look rather suspicious; the likely vector would be through systems which automatically clone URLs not visible to the user, such as Git submodules, or package systems built around Git. The root of the problem is in Git itself, which should not be feeding blank input to helpers. However, the ability to exploit the vulnerability in practice depends on which helpers are in use. Credential helpers which are known to trigger the vulnerability: - Git's ""store"" helper - Git's ""cache"" helper - the ""osxkeychain"" helper that ships in Git's ""contrib"" directory Credential helpers which are known to be safe even with vulnerable versions of Git: - Git Credential Manager for Windows Any helper not in this list should be assumed to trigger the vulnerability.",CVE-2020-11008 Affected versions of Git have a vulnerability whereby Git can be tricked into se...,v6:f2abc72e2c704a30ad46aa0922e9f236,2,13,"{""OssIndex"":{""Url"":""https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vuln/7b5989a8-332c-4074-bbd3-bc91da3230b6?component-type=deb&component-name=ubuntu%2Fgit""}}",2020-09-01 13:18:01.8906619

Due to its low impact a backport has not been made to the `5.x` branch.  ### Workarounds If there is no likelihood that the `tableName` or `schemaName` options sent to the constructor could be of an unsanitized nature, then no workaround is needed. Else the input could be sanitized and escaped before sending it in. Take note though that such an escaping would need to be removed when upgrading to `6.0.1` or later, to avoid double escaping.  ### References * [Security issue disclosure](https://github.com/voxpelli/node-connect-pg-simple/issues/151)  ### For more information If you have any questions or comments about this advisory: * Open an issue in [voxpelli/node-connect-pg-simple](https://github.com/voxpelli/node-connect-pg-simple) * Email maintainer at [pelle@kodfabrik.se](mailto:pelle@kodfabrik.se)  ",CVE-2019-15658,v2:04ffbc2d-ca7b-42b7-82c2-b3f8ca3e6913,0,2,"{""GitHubAdvisories"":{""Url"":""https://github.com/voxpelli/node-connect-pg-simple/security/advisories/GHSA-xqh8-5j36-4556""},""WhiteSource"":{""Url"":""https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-15658""},""NpmAudit"":{""Url"":""https://npmjs.com/advisories/1153""}}",2020-05-09 02:08:14.5799328

But a possibly observable difference in timing when padding error would occur while decrypting the ciphertext makes a padding oracle and an adversary might be able to make use of that oracle to decrypt data without knowing the decryption key by issuing on average 128*b calls to the padding oracle (where b is the number of bytes in the ciphertext block).  ### Patches  All major release versions have had a patch released which ensures the HMAC tag is verified before performing CBC decryption.

The implementation of `ux_device_class_dfu_control_request` function does not assure that a buffer overflow will not occur during handling of the DFU UPLOAD command. When an attacker issues the `UX_SLAVE_CLASS_DFU_COMMAND_UPLOAD` control transfer request with `wLenght` larger than the buffer size (`UX_SLAVE_REQUEST_CONTROL_MAX_LENGTH`, 256 bytes), depending on the actual implementation of `dfu -> ux_slave_class_dfu_read`, a buffer overflow may occur. In example `ux_slave_class_dfu_read` may read 4096 bytes (or more up to 65k) to a 256 byte buffer ultimately resulting in an overflow. Furthermore in case an attacker has some control over the read flash memory, this may result in execution of arbitrary code and platform compromise. A fix for this issue has been included in USBX release 6.1.11. As a workaround, align request and buffer size to assure that buffer boundaries are respected.",CVE-2022-29246,v6:dc9c33d8210042bf8d2b02c10a3e790e,3,9,"{""WhiteSource"":{""Url"":""https://vuln.whitesourcesoftware.com/vulnerability/CVE-2022-29246""}}",2022-05-25 16:41:19.5394278

This vulnerability **does not** allow other users to overwrite the contents of these directories or files. This is purely an information disclosure vulnerability.  When analyzing the impact of this vulnerability, here are the important questions to ask:  1. Do the JUnit tests write sensitive information, like API keys or passwords, into the temporary folder?     - If yes, this vulnerability impacts you, but only if you also answer 'yes' to question 2.     - If no, this vulnerability does not impact you. 2. Do the JUnit tests ever execute in an environment where the OS has other untrusted users.      _This may apply in CI/CD environments but normally won't be 'yes' for personal developer machines._     - If yes, and you answered 'yes' to question 1, this vulnerability impacts you.     - If no, this vulnerability does not impact you.  ### Patches  Because certain JDK file system APIs were only added in JDK 1.7, this this fix is dependent upon the version of the JDK you are using.  - Java 1.7 and higher users: this vulnerability is fixed in 4.13.1.  - Java 1.6 ",CVE-2020-15250,v6:ee43c85b4350405d8cfd59a37ebb5a56,1,3,"{""GitHubAdvisories"":{""Url"":""https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-269g-pwp5-87pp""}}",2023-01-26 21:59:26.4487616

This was intended to include protection in the event of a fork() system call in order to ensure that the parent and child processes did not share the same RNG state. However this protection was not being used in the default case. A partial mitigation for this issue is that the output from a high precision timer is mixed into the RNG state so the likelihood of a parent and child process sharing state is significantly reduced. If an application already calls OPENSSL_init_crypto() explicitly using OPENSSL_INIT_ATFORK then this problem does not occur at all.

22714,176732,26965,380430,"### Impact On Unix like systems, the system's temporary directory is shared between all users on that system.  A collocated user can observe the process of creating a temporary sub directory in the shared temporary directory and race to complete the creation of the temporary subdirectory.  If the attacker wins the race then they will have read and write permission to the subdirectory used to unpack web applications, including their WEB-INF/lib jar files and JSP files.  If any code is ever executed out of this temporary directory, this can lead to a local privilege escalation vulnerability.  Additionally, any user code uses of [WebAppContext::getTempDirectory](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/javadoc/9.4.31.v20200723/org/eclipse/jetty/webapp/WebAppContext.html#getTempDirectory()) would similarly be vulnerable.  Additionally, any user application code using the `ServletContext` attribute for the tempdir will also be impacted. See: https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/javadocs/javax/servlet/ServletContext.html#TEMPDIR  For example: ```java import java.io.File; import java.io.IOException; import javax.servlet.ServletContext; import javax.servlet.ServletException; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;  public class ExampleServlet extends HttpServlet {     @Override     protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) throws ServletException, IOException {         File tempDir = (File)getServletContext().getAttribute(ServletContext.TEMPDIR); // Potentially compromised         // do something with that temp dir     } } ```  Example: The JSP library itself will use the container temp directory for compiling the JSP source into Java classes before executing them.  ### CVSSv3.1 Evaluation  This vulnerability has been calculated to have a [CVSSv3.1 score of 7.8/10 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H&version=3.1)  ##",CVE-2020-27216,v6:18932eea14bd477bbbdd104069dda0b0,2,3,"{""GitHubAdvisories"":{""Url"":""https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/security/advisories/GHSA-g3wg-6mcf-8jj6""},""WhiteSource"":{""Url"":""https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-27216""}}",2021-04-15 08:53:44.5277427

This risk is present whether the source data for the timeline is stored on Google Sheets or in a JSON configuration file. Most TimelineJS users configure their timeline with a Google Sheets document. Those users are exposed to this vulnerability if they grant write access to the document to a malicious inside attacker, if the access of a trusted user is compromised, or if they grant public write access to the document. Some TimelineJS users configure their timeline with a JSON document. Those users are exposed to this vulnerability if they grant write access to the document to a malicious inside attacker, if the access of a trusted user is compromised, or if write access to the system hosting that document is otherwise compromised. Version 3.7.0 of TimelineJS addresses this in two ways. For content which is intended to support limited HTML markup for styling and linking, that content is ""sanitized"" before being added to the DOM. For content intended for simple text display, all markup is stripped. Very few users of TimelineJS actually install the TimelineJS code on their server.

This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`. This logic was insufficient when file paths contained repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would only strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute file path with repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. `///home/user/.bashrc`) would still resolve to an absolute path, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.2, 4.4.14, 5.0.6 and 6.1.1. Users may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom `onentry` method which sanitizes the `entry.path` or a `filter` method which removes entries with absolute paths.

This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary `stat` calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory. This order of operations resulted in the directory being created and added to the `node-tar` directory cache. When a directory is present in the directory cache, subsequent calls to mkdir for that directory are skipped. However, this is also where `node-tar` checks for symlinks occur. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass `node-tar` symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite.

This affects Apache log4j versions from 2.0-beta9 to 2.14.1 (inclusive).   This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute code on the server if the system logs an attacker-controlled string value with the attacker's JNDI LDAP server lookup.  Another vulnerability related to the same library, which was discovered on 12/14/2021 (CVE-2021-45046) and revealed another Remote Code Execution vulnerability, has been investigated by Hazelcast team as well and it is found that it does not affect Hazelcast Products under default configurations.   The finding of CVE-2021-45105 on 12/14/2021, which can cause a Denial of Service attack, was investigated by Hazelcast team and it is confirmed that it does not affect Hazelcast Products under default configurations.   The finding of CVE-2021-44832 on 12/28/2021, which is a medium vulnerability, is investigated by our security team as well, and not considered to be as critical. It requires attacker to be able to modify logging configuration, which means attacker can modify the filesystem and/or can already execute arbitrary code which is more of a general security breach rather than something log4j specific.  Note that Hazelcast IMDG and IMDG Enterprise itself is not affected.  However, given version distributions are considered to be vulnerable since related ZIP and TGZ distributions contain a vulnerable Hazelcast Management Center version.  ### Patches CVE-2021-44228 is fixed in log4j 2.15.0. CVE-2021-45046 is fixed in log4j 2.16.0. CVE-2021-45105 is fixed in log4j 2.17.0. CVE-2021-44832 is fixed in log4j 2.17.1.  As of 12/21/2021, Hazelcast team has released a new version of all affected products that upgrades log4j to 2.17.0 as listed below:  Hazelcast Management Center 4.2021.12-1, Hazelcast Management Center 5.0.4.

Prior to versions 0.34.1 and 0.33.1, there exists a bug in the pooling instance allocator in Wasmtime's runtime where a failure to instantiate an instance for a module that defines an `externref` global will result in an invalid drop of a `VMExternRef` via an uninitialized pointer. A number of conditions listed in the GitHub Security Advisory must be true in order for an instance to be vulnerable to this issue. Maintainers believe that the effective impact of this bug is relatively small because the usage of `externref` is still uncommon and without a resource limiter configured on the `Store`, which is not the default configuration, it is only possible to trigger the bug from an error returned by `mprotect` or `VirtualAlloc`. Note that on Linux with the `uffd` feature enabled, it is only possible to trigger the bug from a resource limiter as the call to `mprotect` is skipped. The bug has been fixed in 0.34.1 and 0.33.1 and users are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible. If it is not possible to upgrade to version 0.34.1 or 0.33.1 of the `wasmtime` crate, it is recommend that support for the reference types proposal be disabled by passing `false` to `Config::wasm_reference_types`.

28257,237716,202642,7296594,"Wasmtime is an open source runtime for WebAssembly & WASI. In Wasmtime from version 0.19.0 and before version 0.30.0 there was a use-after-free bug when passing `externref`s from the host to guest Wasm content. To trigger the bug, you have to explicitly pass multiple `externref`s from the host to a Wasm instance at the same time, either by passing multiple `externref`s as arguments from host code to a Wasm function, or returning multiple `externref`s to Wasm from a multi-value return function defined in the host. If you do not have host code that matches one of these shapes, then you are not impacted. If Wasmtime's `VMExternRefActivationsTable` became filled to capacity after passing the first `externref` in, then passing in the second `externref` could trigger a garbage collection. However the first `externref` is not rooted until we pass control to Wasm, and therefore could be reclaimed by the collector if nothing else was holding a reference to it or otherwise keeping it alive. Then, when control was passed to Wasm after the garbage collection, Wasm could use the first `externref`, which at this point has already been freed. We have reason to believe that the effective impact of this bug is relatively small because usage of `externref` is currently quite rare. The bug has been fixed, and users should upgrade to Wasmtime 0.30.0. If you cannot upgrade Wasmtime yet, you can avoid the bug by disabling reference types support in Wasmtime by passing `false` to `wasmtime::Config::wasm_reference_types`.",CVE-2021-39216,v6:55cadb42a36843898a15fb968b458ac4,0,7,"{""WhiteSource"":{""Url"":""https://vuln.whitesourcesoftware.com/vulnerability/CVE-2021-39216""}}",2022-09-19 12:03:11.3728796
28257,237716,202642,7296597,"Wasmtime is an open source runtime for WebAssembly & WASI. Wasmtime before version 0.30.0 is affected by a type confusion vulnerability. As a Rust library the `wasmtime` crate clearly marks which functions are safe and which are `unsafe`, guaranteeing that if consumers never use `unsafe` then it should not be possible to have memory unsafety issues in their embeddings of Wasmtime. An issue was discovered in the safe API of `Linker::func_*` APIs. These APIs were previously not sound when one `Engine` was used to create the `Linker` and then a different `Engine` was used to create a `Store` and then the `Linker` was used to instantiate a module into that `Store`. Cross-`Engine` usage of functions is not supported in Wasmtime and this can result in type confusion of function pointers, resulting in being able to safely call a function with the wrong type. Triggering this bug requires using at least two `Engine` values in an embedding and then additionally using two different values with a `Linker` (one at the creation time of the `Linker` and another when instantiating a module with the `Linker`). It's expected that usage of more-than-one `Engine` in an embedding is relatively rare since an `Engine` is intended to be a globally shared resource, so the expectation is that the impact of this issue is relatively small. The fix implemented is to change this behavior to `panic!()` in Rust instead of silently allowing it. Using different `Engine` instances with a `Linker` is a programmer bug that `wasmtime` catches at runtime. This bug has been patched and users should upgrade to Wasmtime version 0.30.0. If you cannot upgrade Wasmtime and are using more than one `Engine` in your embedding it's recommended to instead use only one `Engine` for the entire program if possible. An `Engine` is designed to be a globally shared resource that is suitable to have only one for the lifetime of an entire process. If using multiple `Engine`s is required then code should be audited to ensure that `Linker` is only used with one `Engine`.",CVE-2021-39219,v6:f29450dde1d1413087106be828ab72da,0,7,"{""WhiteSource"":{""Url"":""https://vuln.whitesourcesoftware.com/vulnerability/CVE-2021-39219""}}",2022-09-19 12:03:11.3728796

28257,237716,202642,7296635,"Cranelift is an open-source code generator maintained by Bytecode Alliance. It translates a target-independent intermediate representation into executable machine code. There is a bug in 0.73 of the Cranelift x64 backend that can create a scenario that could result in a potential sandbox escape in a Wasm program. This bug was introduced in the new backend on 2020-09-08 and first included in a release on 2020-09-30, but the new backend was not the default prior to 0.73. The recently-released version 0.73 with default settings, and prior versions with an explicit build flag to select the new backend, are vulnerable. The bug in question performs a sign-extend instead of a zero-extend on a value loaded from the stack, under a specific set of circumstances. If those circumstances occur, the bug could allow access to memory addresses upto 2GiB before the start of the Wasm program heap. If the heap bound is larger than 2GiB, then it would be possible to read memory from a computable range dependent on the size of the heaps bound. The impact of this bug is highly dependent on heap implementation, specifically: * if the heap has bounds checks, and * does not rely exclusively on guard pages, and * the heap bound is 2GiB or smaller * then this bug cannot be used to reach memory from another Wasm program heap. The impact of the vulnerability is mitigated if there is no memory mapped in the range accessible using this bug, for example, if there is a 2 GiB guard region before the Wasm program heap. The bug in question performs a sign-extend instead of a zero-extend on a value loaded from the stack, when the register allocator reloads a spilled integer value narrower than 64 bits. This interacts poorly with another optimization: the instruction selector elides a 32-to-64-bit zero-extend operator when we know that an instruction producing a 32-bit value actually zeros the upper 32 bits of its destination register. Hence, we rely on these zeroed bits, but the type of the value is still i32, and the spill/reload reconstitutes thos",CVE-2021-32629,v6:d14558a076934a2e8633f2e09c8b9bd7,1,7,"{""WhiteSource"":{""Url"":""https://vuln.whitesourcesoftware.com/vulnerability/CVE-2021-32629""}}",2022-09-19 12:03:11.3728796

After using an assignment operators such as NotNan::add_assign, NotNan::mul_assign, etc., it was possible for the resulting NotNan value to contain a NaN. This could cause undefined behavior in safe code, because the safe NotNan::cmp method contains internal unsafe code that assumes the value is never NaN. (It could also cause undefined behavior in third-party unsafe code that makes the same assumption, as well as logic errors in safe code.)  This was mitigated starting in version 0.4.0, by panicking if the assigned value is NaN. However, in affected versions from 0.4.0 onward, code that uses the NotNan value during unwinding, or that continues after catching the panic, could still observe the invalid value and trigger undefined behavior.

28257,196843,38976,7238718,"libcurl may read outside of a heap allocated buffer when doing FTP. When libcurl connects to an FTP server and successfully logs in (anonymous or not), it asks the server for the current directory with the `PWD` command. The server then responds with a 257 response containing the path, inside double quotes. The returned path name is then kept by libcurl for subsequent uses. Due to a flaw in the string parser for this directory name, a directory name passed like this but without a closing double quote would lead to libcurl not adding a trailing NUL byte to the buffer holding the name. When libcurl would then later access the string, it could read beyond the allocated heap buffer and crash or wrongly access data beyond the buffer, thinking it was part of the path. A malicious server could abuse this fact and effectively prevent libcurl-based clients to work with it - the PWD command is always issued on new FTP connections and the mistake has a high chance of causing a segfault. The simple fact that this has issue remained undiscovered for this long could suggest that malformed PWD responses are rare in benign servers. We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.

28257,196843,195782,7610656,"Redis is an open-source, in-memory database that persists on disk. In affected versions of Redis an integer overflow bug in 32-bit Redis version 4.0 or newer could be exploited to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution. Redis 4.0 or newer uses a configurable limit for the maximum supported bulk input size. By default, it is 512MB which is a safe value for all platforms. If the limit is significantly increased, receiving a large request from a client may trigger several integer overflow scenarios, which would result with buffer overflow and heap corruption. We believe this could in certain conditions be exploited for remote code execution. By default, authenticated Redis users have access to all configuration parameters and can therefore use the ���CONFIG SET proto-max-bulk-len��� to change the safe default, making the system vulnerable. **This problem only affects 32-bit Redis (on a 32-bit system, or as a 32-bit executable running on a 64-bit system).** The problem is fixed in version 6.2, and the fix is back ported to 6.0.11 and 5.0.11. Make sure you use one of these versions if you are running 32-bit Redis. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent clients from directly executing `CONFIG SET`: Using Redis 6.0 or newer, ACL configuration can be used to block the command. Using older versions, the `rename-command` configuration directive can be used to rename the command to a random string unknown to users, rendering it inaccessible. Please note that this workaround may have an additional impact on users or operational systems that expect `CONFIG SET` to behave in certain ways.",CVE-2021-21309,v6:3809b09396614af6aef72d5188cca92d,1,9,"{""WhiteSource"":{""Url"":""https://vuln.whitesourcesoftware.com/vulnerability/CVE-2021-21309""}}",2023-01-07 07:34:40.8078912

That function may return a negative return value to indicate an internal error (for example out of memory). Such a negative return value is mishandled by OpenSSL and will cause an IO function (such as SSL_connect() or SSL_do_handshake()) to not indicate success and a subsequent call to SSL_get_error() to return the value SSL_ERROR_WANT_RETRY_VERIFY. This return value is only supposed to be returned by OpenSSL if the application has previously called SSL_CTX_set_cert_verify_callback(). Since most applications do not do this the SSL_ERROR_WANT_RETRY_VERIFY return value from SSL_get_error() will be totally unexpected and applications may not behave correctly as a result. The exact behaviour will depend on the application but it could result in crashes, infinite loops or other similar incorrect responses. This issue is made more serious in combination with a separate bug in OpenSSL 3.0 that will cause X509_verify_cert() to indicate an internal error when processing a certificate chain. This will occur where a certificate does not include the Subject Alternative Name extension but where a Certificate Authority has enforced name constraints.

30255,209017,209363,7696179,"Newtonsoft.Json prior to version 13.0.1 is vulnerable to Insecure Defaults due to improper handling of expressions with high nesting level that lead to StackOverFlow exception or high CPU and RAM usage. Exploiting this vulnerability results in Denial Of Service (DoS).   The serialization and deserialization path have different properties regarding the issue.  Deserializing methods (like `JsonConvert.DeserializeObject`) will process the input that results in burning the CPU, allocating memory, and consuming a thread of execution. Quite high nesting level (>10kk, or 9.5MB of `{a:{a:{...` input) is needed to achieve the latency over 10 seconds, depending on the hardware.  Serializing methods (like `JsonConvert.Serialize` or `JObject.ToString`) will throw StackOverFlow exception with the nesting level of around 20k.  To mitigate the issue one either need to update Newtonsoft.Json to 13.0.1 or set `MaxDepth` parameter in the `JsonSerializerSettings`. This can be done globally with the following statement. After that the parsing of the nested input will fail fast with `Newtonsoft.Json.JsonReaderException`:  ```  JsonConvert.DefaultSettings = () => new JsonSerializerSettings { MaxDepth = 128 }; ```  Repro code: ``` //Create a string representation of an highly nested object (JSON serialized) int nRep = 25000; string json = string.Concat(Enumerable.Repeat(""{a:"", nRep)) + ""1"" +  string.Concat(Enumerable.Repeat(""}"", nRep));  //Parse this object (leads to high CPU/RAM consumption) var parsedJson = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(json);  // Methods below all throw stack overflow with nRep around 20k and higher // string a = parsedJson.ToString(); // string b = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(parsedJson); ```  ### Additional affected product and version information **The original statement about the problem only affecting IIS applications is misleading.** Any application is affected, however the IIS has a behavior that stops restarting the instance after some time resulting in a harder-to-fix DoS.**",GHSA-5crp-9r3c-p9vr,v6:c1f3e0e13a83411fa8223dee0bdfd711,2,1,"{""GitHubAdvisories"":{""Url"":""https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5crp-9r3c-p9vr""}}",2023-02-20 14:46:30.8007033

Specifically, the gem was packed with files having their permissions set to `-rw-rw-rw-` (i.e. 0666) instead of `rw-r--r--` (i.e. 0644). This means everyone who is not the owner (Group and Public) with access to the instance where this release had been installed could modify the world-writable files from this gem.   Malicious code already present and running on your machine, separate from this package, could modify the gem’s files and change its behavior during runtime.  ### Patches * [octokit 4.25.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/octokit/versions/4.25.0)  ### Workarounds Users can use the previous version of the gem [v4.22.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/octokit/versions/4.22.0). Alternatively, users can modify the file permissions manually until they are able to upgrade to the latest version.

36200,2618,96118,2382810,"When using the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP), care must be taken when trusting incoming connections to Apache Tomcat. Tomcat treats AJP connections as having higher trust than, for example, a similar HTTP connection. If such connections are available to an attacker, they can be exploited in ways that may be surprising. In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.99, Tomcat shipped with an AJP Connector enabled by default that listened on all configured IP addresses. It was expected (and recommended in the security guide) that this Connector would be disabled if not required. This vulnerability report identified a mechanism that allowed: - returning arbitrary files from anywhere in the web application - processing any file in the web application as a JSP Further, if the web application allowed file upload and stored those files within the web application (or the attacker was able to control the content of the web application by some other means) then this, along with the ability to process a file as a JSP, made remote code execution possible. It is important to note that mitigation is only required if an AJP port is accessible to untrusted users. Users wishing to take a defence-in-depth approach and block the vector that permits returning arbitrary files and execution as JSP may upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later.

The vulnerability allowed to trigger a JavaScript code after fulfilling special conditions:  a) Using one of the affected packages. In case of `ckeditor5-html-support` and `ckeditor5-html-embed`, additionally, it was required to use a configuration that allows unsafe markup inside the editor, b) Initializing the editor on an element and using an element other than `<textarea>` as a base, c) Destroying the editor instance.  The root cause of the issue was a mechanism responsible for updating the source element with the markup coming from the CKEditor 5 data pipeline after destroying the editor.

36208,1786,141338,6559326,"Affected versions of Git have a vulnerability whereby Git can be tricked into sending private credentials to a host controlled by an attacker. Git uses external ""credential helper"" programs to store and retrieve passwords or other credentials from secure storage provided by the operating system. Specially-crafted URLs that contain an encoded newline can inject unintended values into the credential helper protocol stream, causing the credential helper to retrieve the password for one server (e.g., good.example.com) for an HTTP request being made to another server (e.g., evil.example.com), resulting in credentials for the former being sent to the latter. There are no restrictions on the relationship between the two, meaning that an attacker can craft a URL that will present stored credentials for any host to a host of their choosing. The vulnerability can be triggered by feeding a malicious URL to git clone. However, the affected URLs look rather suspicious; the likely vector would be through systems which automatically clone URLs not visible to the user, such as Git submodules, or package systems built around Git. The problem has been patched in the versions published on April 14th, 2020, going back to v2.17.x. Anyone wishing to backport the change further can do so by applying commit 9a6bbee (the full release includes extra checks for git fsck, but that commit is sufficient to protect clients against the vulnerability). The patched versions are: 2.17.4, 2.18.3, 2.19.4, 2.20.3, 2.21.2, 2.22.3, 2.23.2, 2.24.2, 2.25.3, 2.26.1.",CVE-2020-5260,v6:9e052820daca49b489a387b146dcf2a9,1,13,"{""UbuntuCve"":{""Url"":""https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-5260""}}",2022-02-09 00:19:10.0357447
36208,1786,141338,6559327,"Affected versions of Git have a vulnerability whereby Git can be tricked into sending private credentials to a host controlled by an attacker. This bug is similar to CVE-2020-5260(GHSA-qm7j-c969-7j4q). The fix for that bug still left the door open for an exploit where _some_ credential is leaked (but the attacker cannot control which one). Git uses external ""credential helper"" programs to store and retrieve passwords or other credentials from secure storage provided by the operating system. Specially-crafted URLs that are considered illegal as of the recently published Git versions can cause Git to send a ""blank"" pattern to helpers, missing hostname and protocol fields. Many helpers will interpret this as matching _any_ URL, and will return some unspecified stored password, leaking the password to an attacker's server. The vulnerability can be triggered by feeding a malicious URL to `git clone`. However, the affected URLs look rather suspicious; the likely vector would be through systems which automatically clone URLs not visible to the user, such as Git submodules, or package systems built around Git. The root of the problem is in Git itself, which should not be feeding blank input to helpers. However, the ability to exploit the vulnerability in practice depends on which helpers are in use. Credential helpers which are known to trigger the vulnerability: - Git's ""store"" helper - Git's ""cache"" helper - the ""osxkeychain"" helper that ships in Git's ""contrib"" directory Credential helpers which are known to be safe even with vulnerable versions of Git: - Git Credential Manager for Windows Any helper not in this list should be assumed to trigger the vulnerability.",CVE-2020-11008,v6:bf054dc31d864dea876a6b5d280af4c6,1,13,"{""UbuntuCve"":{""Url"":""https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11008""}}",2022-02-09 00:19:10.0357447

When you install this package, the `setup.py` settings installs a `malicious.pth` file to your `site-packages` directory. 2.

However due to the recent changes, in version 1.7.25 no authorization filters are used by default, allowing remote requests to succeed.  ### Impact  Missing authorization when default options are used for the Dashboard UI, e.g. when no custom authorization rules are used as recommended in the [Using Dashboard](https://docs.hangfire.io/en/latest/configuration/using-dashboard.html#configuring-authorization) documentation article.   #### Impacted  If you are using `UseHangfireDashboard` method with default `DashboardOptions.Authorization` property value, then your installation is impacted:  ```csharp app.UseHangfireDashboard(); // Impacted app.UseHangfireDashboard(""/hangfire"", new DashboardOptions()); // Impacted ```  #### Not Impacted  If any other authorization filter is specified in the `DashboardOptions.Authorization` property, the you are not impacted:  ```csharp app.UseHangfireDashboard(""/hangfire"", new DashboardOptions {     Authorization = new []{ new SomeAuthorizationFilter(); } // Not impacted }); ```  ### Patches  Patch is already available in version [1.7.26](https://github.com/HangfireIO/Hangfire/releases/tag/v1.7.26) and already available on NuGet.org, please see [Hangfire.Core 1.7.26](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Hangfire.Core/1.7.26). Default authorization rules now prohibit remote requests by default again by including the `LocalRequestsOnlyAuthorizationFilter` filter to the default settings. Please upgrade to the newest version in order to mitigate the issue.  ### Workarounds  It is possible to fix the issue by using the `LocalRequestsOnlyAuthorizationFilter` explicitly when configuring the Dashboard UI. In this case upgrade is not required.

36366,141891,164504,4800318,"## Overview  Auth0 Lock version 11.20.4 and earlier did not properly sanitize the generated HTML code. Customers using the `additionalSignUpFields` customization option to add a checkbox to the sign-up dialog that are passing a `placeholder` property obtained from an untrusted source (e.g. a query parameter) could allow cross-site scripting (XSS) on their signup pages.  ## Am I affected?  You are affected by this vulnerability if all of the following conditions apply:  - You are using Auth0 Lock version 11.20.4 or earlier. - You pass `additionalSignUpFields` as options when initializing Lock which includes a field of type `checkbox` whose `placeholder` value is obtained from an untrusted source.  An example of a vulnerable snippet is the following where the `placeholder` value is partially user-controlled by the `name` query parameter:  ```javascript <script>     var params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);     var options = {         auth: {             redirectUrl: 'http://localhost:12345/callback',             responseType: 'code',             params: {                 scope: 'openid email',             },         },         additionalSignUpFields: [{             name: 'agree',             type: 'checkbox',             placeholder: ""I agree to Terms and Conditions for "" + params.get('name'),         }],     };     var lock = new Auth0Lock('<CLIENT_ID>', '<TENANT_NAME>.auth0.com', options);     lock.show({         allowShowPassword: true,         initialScreen: 'signUp',     }); </script> ```  ## How to fix that?  Developers using Auth0’s signin solution Lock need to upgrade to version 11.21.0 or later. Version 11.21.0 introduces two changes:  1.

An attacker can execute arbitrary code when the library's - `flashMessage` feature is utilized and user input or data from URL parameters is incorporated into the `flashMessage`. - `languageDictionary` feature is utilized and user input or data from URL parameters is incorporated into the `languageDictionary`.  ### Am I affected? You are affected by this vulnerability if you are using `auth0-lock` version `11.30.0` or lower and all of the following conditions apply:  - You are utilizing `flashMessage` feature. - User input or data from URL parameters is incorporated into the `flashMessage`.  An example of a vulnerable snippet where query parameters are used to populate the `text` property of a `flashMessage`. ```js var params = new URLSearchParams(location.search); var errorMessage = params.get('error__message'); var showParams = {};  if (!!errorMessage === true) {   showParams.flashMessage = {     type: 'error',     text: 'We were unable to log you in.

If you are using Scrapy 1.8 or a lower version, and upgrading to Scrapy 2.6.0 is not an option, you may upgrade to Scrapy 1.8.2 instead.  ¹ At that point the original, user-set cookies have been processed by the cookie middleware into the global or request-specific cookiejar, with their domain restricted to the domain of the original URL, so when the cookie middleware processes the new (redirect) request it will incorporate those cookies into the new request as long as the domain of the new request matches the domain of the original request.  ² This prevents cookie leaks to unintended domains even if the cookies middleware is not used.  ### Workarounds  If you cannot upgrade, set your cookies using a list of dictionaries instead of a single dictionary, as described in the [`Request` documentation](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/request-response.html#scrapy.http.Request), and set the right domain for each cookie.  Alternatively, you can [disable cookies altogether](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#std-setting-COOKIES_ENABLED), or [limit target domains](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spiders.html#scrapy.spiders.Spider.allowed_domains) to domains that you trust with all your user-set cookies.  ### References * Originally reported at [huntr.dev](https://huntr.dev/bounties/3da527b1-2348-4f69-9e88-2e11a96ac585/)  ### For more information  If you have any questions or comments about this advisory: ",CVE-2022-0577,v6:e28095a6f94347f78373e05bbd69fda9,1,8,"{""GitHubAdvisories"":{""Url"":""https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/security/advisories/GHSA-cjvr-mfj7-j4j8""},""WhiteSource"":{""Url"":""https://vuln.whitesourcesoftware.com/vulnerability/CVE-2022-0577""}}",2022-03-02 20:02:30.7173015

36366,141891,182977,7387968,"### Impact _What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_  In Hardened JavaScript, programs can `harden` objects to safely share objects with co-tenant programs without risk of these other programs tampering with their API surface. Hardening does not guarantee that objects are pure or immutable, so a hardened `Map`, for example is superficially tamper-proof, but any party holding a reference to the object can both read and write its contents. Based on this precedent, and because `TypedArray` instances cannot be frozen with `Object.isFrozen`, `harden` does not `freeze` `TypedArrays` and instead makes them non-extensible and makes all non-indexed properties non-writable and non-configurable. This is consistent with the treatment of `Map` because the indexed properties represent mutable content and non-indexed properties represent the API.  Due to a defect in `harden`, properties that have names that parse as numbers but are not the same as the canonical representation of those numbers, as in `""+0""` and `""""` which are both equivalent to their canonical number `""0""`,  remain writable after hardening.  Any program treating one of these properties as part of its API and relying on `harden` to prevent modifications would be vulnerable to an API pollution attack, affecting only instances shared by mutually suspicious parties.  Unlike a `Map`, a hardened `TypedArray` can only have numbers for content. Any program that is sharing hardened `TypedArrays` between co-tentant programs and relying on harden to only allow these programs to communicate exclusively by changing numbers within the bounds of the TypedArray, may inadvertently have arranged for a mechanism for a pair of third-parties to communicate arbitrary objects on these other properties.  ### Patches _Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_  SES version 0.16.0 patches this issue, causing `harden` to recognize properties with non-canonical numeric representations and ensuring that these properties are non-configurable.  ### Workar",GHSA-whpx-q3rq-w8jc,v6:40a04bd0b08d411d98d144641277ce11,0,2,"{""GitHubAdvisories"":{""Url"":""https://github.com/endojs/endo/security/advisories/GHSA-whpx-q3rq-w8jc""}}",2022-10-22 03:41:45.1901203

This was intended to include protection in the event of a fork() system call in order to ensure that the parent and child processes did not share the same RNG state. However this protection was not being used in the default case. A partial mitigation for this issue is that the output from a high precision timer is mixed into the RNG state so the likelihood of a parent and child process sharing state is significantly reduced.

36366,153560,177665,7212749,"### Impact An information disclosure vulnerability in `next-auth` before `v4.10.2` and `v3.29.9` allows an attacker with log access privilege to obtain excessive information such as an identity provider's secret in the log (which is thrown during OAuth error handling) and use it to leverage further attacks on the system, like impersonating the client to ask for extensive permissions.  ### Patches We patched this vulnerability in `v4.10.2` and `v3.29.9` by moving the log for `provider` information to the debug level. In addition, we added a warning for having the `debug: true` option turned on in production and documented it [here](https://next-auth.js.org/warnings#debug_enabled). > You have enabled the debug option. It is meant for development only, to help you catch issues in your authentication flow and you should consider removing this option when deploying to production. One way of only allowing debugging while not in production is to set debug: process.env.NODE_ENV !== ""production"", so you can commit this without needing to change the value. >  > If you want to log debug messages during production anyway, we recommend setting the [logger option](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options#logger) with proper sanitization of potentially sensitive user information.

If an attacker could forge a request that sent a comma-separated list of emails (eg.: `attacker@attacker.com,victim@victim.com`) to the sign-in endpoint, NextAuth.js would send emails to both the attacker and the victim's e-mail addresses. The attacker could then login as a newly created user with the email being `attacker@attacker.com,victim@victim.com`. This means that basic authorization like `email.endsWith(""@victim.com"")` in the `signIn` callback would fail to communicate a threat to the developer and would let the attacker bypass authorization, even with an `@attacker.com` address.  ### Patches We patched this vulnerability in `v4.10.3` and `v3.29.10` by normalizing the email value that is sent to the sign-in endpoint before accessing it anywhere else. We also added a `normalizeIdentifier` callback on the `EmailProvider` configuration, where you can further tweak your requirements for what your system considers a valid e-mail address. (E.g.: strict RFC2821 compliance)  To upgrade, run one of the following: ```sh npm i next-auth@latest ``` ```sh yarn add next-auth@latest ``` ```sh pnpm add next-auth@latest ```  (This will update to the latest v4 version, but you can change `latest` to `3` if you want to stay on v3.

36366,1830,203090,7311518,"In TensorFlow Lite before versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, saved models in the flatbuffer format use a double indexing scheme: a model has a set of subgraphs, each subgraph has a set of operators and each operator has a set of input/output tensors. The flatbuffer format uses indices for the tensors, indexing into an array of tensors that is owned by the subgraph. This results in a pattern of double array indexing when trying to get the data of each tensor. However, some operators can have some tensors be optional. To handle this scenario, the flatbuffer model uses a negative `-1` value as index for these tensors. This results in special casing during validation at model loading time. Unfortunately, this means that the `-1` index is a valid tensor index for any operator, including those that don't expect optional inputs and including for output tensors. Thus, this allows writing and reading from outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays, although only at a specific offset from the start of these arrays. This results in both read and write gadgets, albeit very limited in scope. The issue is patched in several commits (46d5b0852, 00302787b7, e11f5558, cd31fd0ce, 1970c21, and fff2c83), and is released in TensorFlow versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, or 2.3.1. A potential workaround would be to add a custom `Verifier` to the model loading code to ensure that only operators which accept optional inputs use the `-1` special value and only for the tensors that they expect to be optional.

If the export server is exposed to the internet, this potentially allows a malicious user to gain read access to internal web-resources.  The impact is limited to internal services that serve content via. HTTP(S), and requires the attacker to know internal hostnames/IP addresses.  The previous versions have been marked as deprecated on NPM.  ### Patches  Version 2.1.0 released alongside this security advisory addresses the issue. **Please note that this release is not backwards compatible out of the box. See the [changelog](https://github.com/highcharts/node-export-server/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for details.**  Additionally, it's also recommended to upgrade to the latest version of Highcharts to get the added input sanitation implemented in version 9.0 and later.   ### Workarounds  There are no known workarounds to the issue - an upgrade to version 2.1.0 is required.  ### For more information If you have any questions or comments about this advisory: * Open an issue in [the export server issue tracker](https://github.com/highcharts/node-export-server/issues) * Email us at [security@highsoft.com](mailto:security@highsoft.com)",GHSA-hfwx-c7q6-g54c,v6:8bad2a2e34084b70b5f23f3c6d651ba8,2,2,"{""GitHubAdvisories"":{""Url"":""https://github.com/highcharts/node-export-server/security/advisories/GHSA-hfwx-c7q6-g54c""}}",2021-03-19 19:07:19.5163319

Depending on the application, this may for example enable the attacker to spoof other user's identities, hijack their sessions, or bypass authentication.  ### Patches Users should upgrade to version 3.3.4 Fixed by: https://github.com/davedoesdev/python-jwt/commit/88ad9e67c53aa5f7c43ec4aa52ed34b7930068c9  ### Workarounds None  ### References Found by [Tom Tervoort](Tom.Tervoort@secura.com) https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/blob/main/vulns/python-jwt/PYSEC-2022-259.yaml  ### More information  The vulnerability allows an attacker, who possesses a single valid JWT, to create a new token with forged claims that the verify_jwt function will accept as valid.  The issue is caused by an inconsistency between the JWT parsers used by python-jwt and its dependency jwcrypto. By mixing compact and JSON representations, an attacker can trick jwcrypto of parsing different claims than those over which a signature is validated by jwcrypto.  Testing the fix has been added as an [automated unit test](https://github.com/davedoesdev/python-jwt/blob/master/test/vulnerability_vows.py) to python-jwt.

36370,2614,134484,7037376,"Rsyslog is a rocket-fast system for log processing. Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read. While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`, `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important modules.

When plugins are used with the driver, it instantiates plugin instances based on Java class names provided via the `sslhostnameverifier`, `socketFactory`, `sslfactory`, and `sslpasswordcallback` connection properties.

This can lead to loading of arbitrary Java classes, which a knowledgeable attacker with control over the JDBC URL can use to achieve remote code execution.  ### Patches  This issue is patched within `redshift-jdbc-42` 2.1.0.8 and above.  ### Workarounds  We advise customers using plugins to upgrade to `redshift-jdbc42` version 2.1.0.8 or above.

38137,280103,197601,7055589,"ChaCha20-Poly1305 is an AEAD cipher, and requires a unique nonce input for every encryption operation. RFC 7539 specifies that the nonce value (IV) should be 96 bits (12 bytes). OpenSSL allows a variable nonce length and front pads the nonce with 0 bytes if it is less than 12 bytes. However it also incorrectly allows a nonce to be set of up to 16 bytes. In this case only the last 12 bytes are significant and any additional leading bytes are ignored. It is a requirement of using this cipher that nonce values are unique. Messages encrypted using a reused nonce value are susceptible to serious confidentiality and integrity attacks. If an application changes the default nonce length to be longer than 12 bytes and then makes a change to the leading bytes of the nonce expecting the new value to be a new unique nonce then such an application could inadvertently encrypt messages with a reused nonce. Additionally the ignored bytes in a long nonce are not covered by the integrity guarantee of this cipher. Any application that relies on the integrity of these ignored leading bytes of a long nonce may be further affected. Any OpenSSL internal use of this cipher, including in SSL/TLS, is safe because no such use sets such a long nonce value. However user applications that use this cipher directly and set a non-default nonce length to be longer than 12 bytes may be vulnerable. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1 and 1.1.0 are affected by this issue.

38137,280103,197601,7055592,"Normally in OpenSSL EC groups always have a co-factor present and this is used in side channel resistant code paths. However, in some cases, it is possible to construct a group using explicit parameters (instead of using a named curve). In those cases it is possible that such a group does not have the cofactor present. This can occur even where all the parameters match a known named curve. If such a curve is used then OpenSSL falls back to non-side channel resistant code paths which may result in full key recovery during an ECDSA signature operation. In order to be vulnerable an attacker would have to have the ability to time the creation of a large number of signatures where explicit parameters with no co-factor present are in use by an application using libcrypto. For the avoidance of doubt libssl is not vulnerable because explicit parameters are never used. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k).

38137,280103,197601,7055593,"There is an overflow bug in the AVX2 Montgomery multiplication procedure used in exponentiation with 1024-bit moduli. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH1024 are considered just feasible, because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be significant. However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share the DH1024 private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701. This only affects processors that support the AVX2 but not ADX extensions like Intel Haswell (4th generation).

The impact of this issue is possible Arbitrary Command Injection when `npmcli/git` is run with untrusted (user controlled) Git command arguments.   ### Impact  Arbitrary Command Injection  ### Details  `npmcli/git` prior to release `2.0.8` passed user controlled input as arguments to a shell command without properly sanitizing this input. Passing unsanitized input to a shell can lead to arbitrary command injection. For example passing `git+https://github.com/npm/git; echo hello world` would trigger the shell execution of `echo hello world`.    This issue was remediated by no longer running `npmcli/git` git commands through an intermediate shell.  ### Patches  This issue has been patched in release `2.0.8`  ### Acknowledgements  This report was reported to us by @tyage (Ierae Security) through the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com).

39580,289569,209369,7696578,"### Impact  Arbitrary File Creation, Arbitrary File Overwrite, Arbitrary Code Execution  `@npmcli/arborist`, the library that calculates dependency trees and manages the `node_modules` folder hierarchy for the npm command line interface, aims to guarantee that package dependency contracts will be met, and the extraction of package contents will always be performed into the expected folder.  This is, in part, accomplished by resolving dependency specifiers defined in `package.json` manifests for dependencies with a specific name, and nesting folders to resolve conflicting dependencies.  When multiple dependencies differ only in the case of their name, Arborist's internal data structure saw them as separate items that could coexist within the same level in the `node_modules` hierarchy.  However, on case-insensitive file systems (such as macOS and Windows), this is not the case.  Combined with a symlink dependency such as `file:/some/path`, this allowed an attacker to create a situation in which arbitrary contents could be written to any location on the filesystem.  For example, a package `pwn-a` could define a dependency in their `package.json` file such as `""foo"": ""file:/some/path""`.  Another package, `pwn-b` could define a dependency such as `FOO: ""file:foo.tgz""`.  On case-insensitive file systems, if `pwn-a` was installed, and then `pwn-b` was installed afterwards, the contents of `foo.tgz` would be written to `/some/path`, and any existing contents of `/some/path` would be removed.  Anyone using npm v7.20.6 or earlier on a case-insensitive filesystem is potentially affected.  ### Patches  2.8.2 (included in npm v7.20.7 and above)  ### Fix and Caveats  There are two parts to the fix:  1. Immediately prior to extraction, if the target folder is not a directory, it is moved aside.

39580,289569,209369,7696579,"### Impact  Arbitrary File Creation, Arbitrary File Overwrite, Arbitrary Code Execution  `@npmcli/arborist`, the library that calculates dependency trees and manages the node_modules folder hierarchy for the npm command line interface, aims to guarantee that package dependency contracts will be met, and the extraction of package contents will always be performed into the expected folder.  This is accomplished by extracting package contents into a project's `node_modules` folder.  If the `node_modules` folder of the root project or any of its dependencies is somehow replaced with a symbolic link, it could allow Arborist to write package dependencies to any arbitrary location on the file system.  Note that symbolic links contained within package artifact contents are filtered out, so another means of creating a `node_modules` symbolic link would have to be employed.  1. A `preinstall` script could replace `node_modules` with a symlink.  (This is prevented by using `--ignore-scripts`.) 2. An attacker could supply the target with a git repository, instructing them to run `npm install --ignore-scripts` in the root.  This may be successful, because `npm install --ignore-scripts` is typically not capable of making changes outside of the project directory, so it may be deemed safe.  ### Patches  2.8.2 (included in npm v7.20.7 and above)  ### Workarounds  Do not run `npm install` on untrusted codebases, without first ensuring that the `node_modules` directory in the project is not a symbolic link.  ### Fix  Prior to extracting any package contents, the `node_modules` folder into which it is extracted is verified to be a real directory.  If it is not, then it is removed.  Caveat: if you are currently relying on creating a symbolic link to the `node_modules` folder in order to share dependencies between projects, then that will no longer be possible.  Please use the `npm link` command, explicit `file:...` dependencies, and/or `workspaces` to share dependencies in a development environment.",CVE-2021-39135,v6:c08c8251e8b240eaa64283d72e2edb0a,2,2,"{""GitHubAdvisories"":{""Url"":""https://github.com/npm/arborist/security/advisories/GHSA-gmw6-94gg-2rc2""},""WhiteSource"":{""Url"":""https://vuln.whitesourcesoftware.com/vulnerability/CVE-2021-39135""}}",2023-02-20 15:52:44.4176859

This then results in writing to `out(-1, bin)`, which is before the heap allocated buffer for the output tensor.  ### Patches We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [eebb96c2830d48597d055d247c0e9aebaea94cd5](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/eebb96c2830d48597d055d247c0e9aebaea94cd5).

An attacker can craft a malicious URL with file paths and the streamlit server would process that URL and return the contents of that file.  ### Patches On July 27th at 2:20PM PST we rolled out a patch in release 1.11.1. This patch ensures that any file operations are restricted only to the custom component directory and cannot traverse outside of that. We strongly recommend users upgrade to v1.11.1 as soon as possible. We have notified the Streamlit community and popular hosting providers about this issue so they can patch quickly. As a precautionary measure, we are also upgrading all users on Streamlit Cloud wherever possible. We continue to check other occurrences of this vulnerability and monitor potential exploits wherever we can.  Finally, as a general security practice, we recommend users review custom components for any malicious code before using them in their apps. Following security best practices such as running web servers with low privileges, firewalls, etc. for hosting your apps, helps in mitigating the severity of such exploits.  ### Workarounds None.  ### References * https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRzF9K6gwv9KnQz---1pt0SdHMVt-CHuKMmdTH1uct7xPcK7vToP4FvYdI84aO6rGfCmrBSaViri0Nd/pub  ### For more information If you have any questions or comments about this advisory: * Email us at [security@streamlit.io](mailto:security@streamlit.io) ",CVE-2022-35918,v6:3429751123e94645bdac5ac1929acf22,1,8,"{""GitHubAdvisories"":{""Url"":""https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/security/advisories/GHSA-v4hr-4jpx-56gc""},""WhiteSource"":{""Url"":""https://vuln.whitesourcesoftware.com/vulnerability/CVE-2022-35918""}}",2022-12-17 00:50:38.9564933

Following types of the Java runtime are affected in Java versions available in December 2021:  - java.util.HashMap - java.util.HashSet - java.util.Hashtable - java.util.LinkedHashMap - java.util.LinkedHashSet - java.util.Stack (older Java revisions only) - java.util.Vector (older Java revisions only) - Other third party collection implementations that use their element's hash code may also be affected  If your object graph does not use referenced elements at all, you may simply set the NO_REFERENCE mode: ```Java XStream xstream = new XStream(); xstream.setMode(XStream.NO_REFERENCES); ```  If your object graph contains neither a Hashtable, HashMap nor a HashSet (or one of the linked variants of it) then you can use the security framework to deny the usage of these types: ```Java XStream xstream = new XStream(); xstream.denyTypes(new Class[]{  java.util.HashMap.class, java.util.HashSet.class, java.util.Hashtable.class, java.util.LinkedHashMap.class, java.util.LinkedHashSet.class }); ```  Unfortunately these types are very common.

In mod_cluster, this continues until the next STATUS request (10 seconds intervals) from the application server updates the server state.

In mod_proxy_balancer, it does not forward requests to the worker until the ""retry"" timeout passes. However, luckily, mod_proxy_balancer has ""forcerecovery"" setting (On by default; this parameter can force the immediate recovery of all workers without considering the retry parameter of the workers if all workers of a balancer are in error state.).

41572,308138,203684,7327165,"### Overview  A partial-path traversal issue exists within the `downloadDirectory` method in the AWS S3 TransferManager component of the AWS SDK for Java v1. Applications using the SDK control the `destinationDirectory` argument, but S3 object keys are determined by the application that uploaded the objects. The `downloadDirectory` method allows the caller to pass a filesystem object in the object key but contained an issue in the validation logic for the key name. A knowledgeable actor could bypass the validation logic by including a UNIX double-dot in the bucket key. Under certain conditions, this could permit them to retrieve a directory from their S3 bucket that is one level up in the filesystem from their working directory.   This issue’s scope is limited to directories whose name prefix matches the destinationDirectory. E.g. for destination directory`/tmp/foo`, the actor can cause a download to `/tmp/foo-bar`, but not `/tmp/bar`.   Versions of the AWS Java SDK for S3 v1 before and including v1.12.260 are affected by this issue.   ### Impact  If `com.amazonaws.services.s3.transfer.TransferManager::downloadDirectory` is used to download an untrusted buckets contents, the contents of that bucket can be written outside of the intended destination directory.  #### Root Cause  The `com.amazonaws.services.s3.transfer.TransferManager::downloadDirectory` contains a partial-path traversal vulnerability.  This is due to the guard logic in `leavesRoot` containing an insufficient protection against partial-path traversal.  https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/blob/5be0807af763b9fbf6b0a153c76dd305e407f035/aws-java-sdk-s3/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/services/s3/transfer/TransferManager.java#L1513-L1519  The application controls the `localBaseDirectory` argument, but the `key` comes from the AWS bucket entry (ie. can be attacker controlled). The above bit of logic can be bypassed with the following payloads:  ```java // The following will return 'false', although the attacker value will ""leave"" the `/usr/foo` directory leav",CVE-2022-31159,v6:9966444095074edf8dbd353692fee1f4,2,3,"{""GitHubAdvisories"":{""Url"":""https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/security/advisories/GHSA-c28r-hw5m-5gv3""},""WhiteSource"":{""Url"":""https://vuln.whitesourcesoftware.com/vulnerability/CVE-2022-31159""}}",2022-10-09 18:10:57.5716781

This vulnerability pollutes the prototype of the object returned by `JSON5.parse` and not the global Object prototype, which is the commonly understood definition of Prototype Pollution. However, polluting the prototype of a single object can have significant security impact for an application if the object is later used in trusted operations.  ## Impact This vulnerability could allow an attacker to set arbitrary and unexpected keys on the object returned from `JSON5.parse`. The actual impact will depend on how applications utilize the returned object and how they filter unwanted keys, but could include denial of service, cross-site scripting, elevation of privilege, and in extreme cases, remote code execution.  ## Mitigation This vulnerability is patched in json v2.2.2 and later.  ## Details Suppose a developer wants to allow users and admins to perform some risky operation, but they want to restrict what non-admins can do. To accomplish this, they accept a JSON blob from the user, parse it using `JSON5.parse`, confirm that the provided data does not set some sensitive keys, and then performs the risky operation using the validated data:  ```js const JSON5 = require('json5');  const doSomethingDangerous = (props) => {   if (props.isAdmin) {     console.log('Doing dangerous thing as admin.');   } else {     console.log('Doing dangerous thing as user.');   } };  const secCheckKeysSet = (obj, searchKeys) => {   let searchKeyFound = false;   Object.keys(obj).forEach((key) => {     if (searchKeys.indexOf(key) > -1) {       searchKeyFound = true;     }   });   return searchKeyFound; };  const props = JSON5.parse('{""foo"": ""bar""}'); if (!secCheckKeysSet(props, ['isAdmin', 'isMod'])) {   doSomethingDangerous(props); // ""Doing dangerous thing as user."" } else {   throw new Error('Forbidden...'); } ```  If an a",CVE-2022-46175,v6:a3696e2b7c0b4df8b59a170acc467080,2,2,"{""GitHubAdvisories"":{""Url"":""https://github.com/json5/json5/security/advisories/GHSA-9c47-m6qq-7p4h""}}",2023-01-02 15:03:10.8233333
