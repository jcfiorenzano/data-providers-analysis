Workarounds  -----------  This vulnerability can be mitigated by wrapping `render` calls with  `respond_to` blocks.  For example, the following example is vulnerable:   ```  class UserController < ApplicationController    def index      render ""index""    end  end  ```   But the following code is not vulnerable:   ```  class UserController < ApplicationController    def index      respond_to |format|        format.html { render ""index"" }      end    end  end  ```   Implicit rendering is impacted, so this code is vulnerable:   ```  class UserController < ApplicationController    def index    end  end  ```   But can be changed this this:   ```  class UserController < ApplicationController    def index      respond_to |format|        format.html { render ""index"" }      end    end  end  ```   Alternatively to specifying the format, the following monkey patch can be  applied in an initializer:   ```  $ cat config/initializers/formats_filter.rb  # frozen_string_literal: true   ActionDispatch::Request.prepend(Module.new do    def formats      super().select do |format|        format.symbol || format.ref == ""*/*""      end    end  end)  ```   Please note that only the 5.2.x, 5.1.x, 5.0.x, and 4.2.x series are supported  at present.

Please note the misleadingly named `nodeIntegrationInSubFrames` option does not implicitly grant Node.js access rather it depends on the existing `sandbox` setting.  If your application is sandboxed then `nodeIntegrationInSubFrames` just gives access to the sandboxed renderer APIs (which includes `ipcRenderer`).  If your application then additionally exposes IPC messages without IPC `senderFrame` validation that perform privileged actions or return confidential data this access to `ipcRenderer` can in turn compromise your application / user even with the sandbox enabled.  ### Patches This has been patched and the following Electron versions contain the fix:  * `18.0.0-beta.6` * `17.2.0` * `16.2.6` * `15.5.5`  ### Workarounds Ensure that all IPC message handlers appropriately validate `senderFrame` as per our [security tutorial here](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/main/docs/tutorial/security.md#17-validate-the-sender-of-all-ipc-messages).  ### For more information  If you have any questions or comments about this advisory, email us at [security@electronjs.org](mailto:security@electronjs.org).",CVE-2022-29247,v6:c6069f38bdd04188878bb188dee7ef4b,0,2,"{""GitHubAdvisories"":{""Url"":""https://github.com/electron/electron/security/advisories/GHSA-mq8j-3h7h-p8g7""}}",2022-11-03 16:29:22.1644371

3,1791,267,4505694,"### Impact  The issue is as follows: when `msgpack5` decodes a map containing a  key `""__proto__""`, it assigns the decoded value to `__proto__`. As you  are no doubt aware, `Object.prototype.__proto__` is an accessor  property for the receiver's prototype. If the value corresponding to  the key `__proto__` decodes to an object or `null`, `msgpack5` sets  the decoded object's prototype to that value.   An attacker who can submit crafted MessagePack data to a service can  use this to produce values that appear to be of other types; may have  unexpected prototype properties and methods (for example `length`,  numeric properties, and `push` et al if `__proto__`'s value decodes to  an `Array`); and/or may throw unexpected exceptions when used (for  example if the `__proto__` value decodes to a `Map` or `Date`). Other  unexpected behavior might be produced for other types.   There is no effect on the global prototype.  An example:   ```js  const msgpack5 = require('msgpack5')();   const payload = {};  Object.defineProperty(payload, '__proto__', {  value: new Map().set(1, 2),  enumerable: true  });   const encoded = msgpack5.encode(payload);  console.log(encoded); // <Buffer 81 a9 5f 5f 70 72 6f 74 6f 5f 5f 81 01 02>   const decoded = msgpack5.decode(encoded);   // decoded's prototype has been overwritten  console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(decoded)); // Map(1) { 1 => 2 }  console.log(decoded.get); // [Function: get]   // decoded appears to most common typechecks to be a Map  console.log(decoded instanceof Map); // true  console.log(decoded.toString()); // [object Map]  console.log(Object.prototype.toString.call(decoded)); // [object Map]  console.log(decoded.constructor.name); // Map  console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(decoded).constructor.name); // Map   // decoded is not, however, a Map  console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(decoded) === Map.prototype); // false   // using decoded as though it were a Map throws  try {  decoded.get(1);  } catch (error) {  console.log(error); // TypeError: Method Map.prototype.get called  //",CVE-2021-21368,v6:4f0fe4f22b4c45a2ac82e6a9b6324daf,1,2,"{""GitHubAdvisories"":{""Url"":""https://github.com/mcollina/msgpack5/security/advisories/GHSA-gmjw-49p4-pcfm""},""WhiteSource"":{""Url"":""https://vuln.whitesourcesoftware.com/vulnerability/CVE-2021-21368""}}",2021-03-13 11:58:35.6794064

In affected versions passing either `'infinity'`, `'inf'` or `float('inf')` (or their negatives) to `datetime` or `date` fields causes validation to run forever with 100% CPU usage (on one CPU). Pydantic has been patched with fixes available in the following versions: v1.8.2, v1.7.4, v1.6.2. All these versions are available on pypi(https://pypi.org/project/pydantic/#history), and will be available on conda-forge(https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pydantic) soon. See the changelog(https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) for details. If you absolutely can't upgrade, you can work around this risk using a validator(https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/validators/) to catch these values.

In those cases it is possible that such a group does not have the cofactor present. This can occur even where all the parameters match a known named curve.

3,1791,89538,6460412,"ChaCha20-Poly1305 is an AEAD cipher, and requires a unique nonce input for every encryption operation. RFC 7539 specifies that the nonce value (IV) should be 96 bits (12 bytes). OpenSSL allows a variable nonce length and front pads the nonce with 0 bytes if it is less than 12 bytes. However it also incorrectly allows a nonce to be set of up to 16 bytes. In this case only the last 12 bytes are significant and any additional leading bytes are ignored. It is a requirement of using this cipher that nonce values are unique. Messages encrypted using a reused nonce value are susceptible to serious confidentiality and integrity attacks. If an application changes the default nonce length to be longer than 12 bytes and then makes a change to the leading bytes of the nonce expecting the new value to be a new unique nonce then such an application could inadvertently encrypt messages with a reused nonce. Additionally the ignored bytes in a long nonce are not covered by the integrity guarantee of this cipher. Any application that relies on the integrity of these ignored leading bytes of a long nonce may be further affected. Any OpenSSL internal use of this cipher, including in SSL/TLS, is safe because no such use sets such a long nonce value. However user applications that use this cipher directly and set a non-default nonce length to be longer than 12 bytes may be vulnerable. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1 and 1.1.0 are affected by this issue.

3,1791,104286,7731369,"### Impact The [graphql-upload](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-upload) npm package can execute GraphQL operations contained in `content-type: multipart/form-data` POST requests. Because they are POST requests, they can contain GraphQL mutations. Because they use `content-type: multipart/form-data`, they can be ""simple requests"" which are not preflighted by browsers.  If your GraphQL server uses `graphql-upload` and uses `SameSite=None` cookies for authentication, then JS on any origin can cause browsers to send cookie-authenticated mutations to your GraphQL server, which will be executed without checking your CORS policy first. (The attack won't be able to see the response to the mutation if your CORS policy is set up properly, but the side effects of the mutation will still happen.)  Additionally, if your GraphQL server uses `graphql-upload` relies on network properties for security (whether by explicitly looking at the client's IP address or by only being available on a private network), then JS on any origin can cause browsers (which may be on a private network or have an allowed IP address) to send mutations to your GraphQL server, which will be executed without checking your CORS policy first. (This attack does not require your server to use cookies. It is in some cases prevented by some browsers such as Chrome.)  Apollo Server 2 bundled `graphql-upload` and enabled it by default, so by default, Apollo Server 2 servers are vulnerable to these CSRF attacks.  (Apollo Server 1 did not bundle `graphql-upload`. Apollo Server 3 no longer bundles `graphql-upload`, although AS3's docs do document how to manually integrate with `graphql-upload`.) It is enabled even if your server makes no use of the upload functionality.  If you are running Apollo Server 2 (older than v2.25.4) and do not specify `uploads: false` to `new ApolloServer`, then you are vulnerable to this CSRF mutation attack.

There is a cross-site scripting vulnerability in GraphQL Playground that allows for arbitrary JavaScript code execution in your web server's origin. If a user clicks a specially crafted link to your GraphQL Playground page served by Apollo Server, an attacker can steal cookies and other private browser data.  Details of the underlying GraphQL Playground vulnerability are available in [this `graphql-playground` advisory](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground/security/advisories/GHSA-59r9-6jp6-jcm7). (A [similar vulnerability](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/security/advisories/GHSA-x4r7-m2q9-69c8) exists in the related `graphiql` project.) This advisory focuses on identifying whether *Apollo Server* installations are vulnerable and mitigating the vulnerability in Apollo Server; see the other advisories for details on the XSS vulnerability itself.  The impact of this vulnerability is more severe if (as is common) your GraphQL server's origin URL is an origin that is used to store sensitive data such as cookies.

By adding a URL path parameter with an encoded ""/"" to a request, an attacker may be able to bypass a security constraint. The root cause of this issue is a lack of clarity regarding the handling of path parameters in the Servlet Specification (see below). Some Servlet containers include path parameters in the value returned for getPathInfo() and some do not. Spring Security uses the value returned by getPathInfo() as part of the process of mapping requests to security constraints. The unexpected presence of path parameters can cause a constraint to be bypassed.  Users of Apache Tomcat (all current versions) are not affected by this vulnerability since Tomcat follows the guidance previously provided by the Servlet Expert group and strips path parameters from the value returned by getContextPath(), getServletPath() and getPathInfo() [1].  Users of other Servlet containers based on Apache Tomcat may or may not be affected depending on whether or not the handling of path parameters has been modified.

Depending on the application, this may for example enable the attacker to spoof other user's identities, hijack their sessions, or bypass authentication.  ### Patches Users should upgrade to version 3.3.4 Fixed by: https://github.com/davedoesdev/python-jwt/commit/88ad9e67c53aa5f7c43ec4aa52ed34b7930068c9  ### Workarounds None  ### References Found by [Tom Tervoort](Tom.Tervoort@secura.com) https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/blob/main/vulns/python-jwt/PYSEC-2022-259.yaml  ### More information  The vulnerability allows an attacker, who possesses a single valid JWT, to create a new token with forged claims that the verify_jwt function will accept as valid.  The issue is caused by an inconsistency between the JWT parsers used by python-jwt and its dependency jwcrypto. By mixing compact and JSON representations, an attacker can trick jwcrypto of parsing different claims than those over which a signature is validated by jwcrypto.  Testing the fix has been added as an [automated unit test](https://github.com/davedoesdev/python-jwt/blob/master/test/vulnerability_vows.py) to python-jwt.

This includes requests generated by Scrapy components, such as `robots.txt` requests sent by Scrapy when the `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` setting is set to `True`, or as requests reached through redirects.  ### Patches  Upgrade to Scrapy 2.5.1 and use the new `http_auth_domain` spider attribute to control which domains are allowed to receive the configured HTTP authentication credentials.

If you are using Scrapy 1.8 or a lower version, and upgrading to Scrapy 2.6.0 is not an option, you may upgrade to Scrapy 1.8.2 instead.  ¹ At that point the original, user-set cookies have been processed by the cookie middleware into the global or request-specific cookiejar, with their domain restricted to the domain of the original URL, so when the cookie middleware processes the new (redirect) request it will incorporate those cookies into the new request as long as the domain of the new request matches the domain of the original request.  ² This prevents cookie leaks to unintended domains even if the cookies middleware is not used.  ### Workarounds  If you cannot upgrade, set your cookies using a list of dictionaries instead of a single dictionary, as described in the [`Request` documentation](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/request-response.html#scrapy.http.Request), and set the right domain for each cookie.

There are third-party proxy-rotation downloader middlewares that set different `proxy` metadata every time they process a request.  Because of request retries and redirects, the same request can be processed by downloader middlewares more than once, including both the built-in HTTP proxy downloader middleware and any third-party proxy-rotation downloader middleware.  These third-party proxy-rotation downloader middlewares could change the `proxy` metadata of a request to a new value, but fail to remove the `Proxy-Authentication` header from the previous value of the `proxy` metadata, causing the credentials of one proxy to be leaked to a different proxy.  If you rotate proxies from different proxy providers, and any of those proxies requires credentials, you are affected, unless you are handling proxy rotation as described under **Workarounds** below. If you use a third-party downloader middleware for proxy rotation, the same applies to that downloader middleware, and installing a patched version of Scrapy may not be enough; patching that downloader middlware may be necessary as well.  ### Patches  Upgrade to Scrapy 2.6.2.  If you are using Scrapy 1.8 or a lower version, and upgrading to Scrapy 2.6.2 is not an option, you may upgrade to Scrapy 1.8.3 instead.  ### Workarounds  If you cannot upgrade, make sure that any code that changes the value of the `proxy` request meta also removes the `Proxy-Authorization` header from the request if present.  ### For more information  If you have any questions or comments about this advisory: * [Open an issue](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues) * [Email us](mailto:opensour",GHSA-9x8m-2xpf-crp3,v6:c145f03b37c54da1804b04bf43ec1ff0,1,8,"{""GitHubAdvisories"":{""Url"":""https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/security/advisories/GHSA-9x8m-2xpf-crp3""}}",2022-07-31 21:16:48.8937335

3,1793,165903,7182524,"Rsyslog is a rocket-fast system for log processing. Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read. While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`, `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important modules.

3,1793,194927,7538712,"Normally in OpenSSL EC groups always have a co-factor present and this is used in side channel resistant code paths. However, in some cases, it is possible to construct a group using explicit parameters (instead of using a named curve). In those cases it is possible that such a group does not have the cofactor present. This can occur even where all the parameters match a known named curve. If such a curve is used then OpenSSL falls back to non-side channel resistant code paths which may result in full key recovery during an ECDSA signature operation. In order to be vulnerable an attacker would have to have the ability to time the creation of a large number of signatures where explicit parameters with no co-factor present are in use by an application using libcrypto.

Workflows that log untrusted data to stdout may invoke these commands, resulting in the path or environment variables being modified without the intention of the workflow or action author.   ### Patches The runner will release an update that disables the `set-env` and `add-path` workflow commands in the near future. For now, users should upgrade to `@actions/core v1.2.6` or later, and replace any instance of the `set-env` or `add-path` commands in their workflows with the new [Environment File Syntax](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/main/docs/commands.md#environment-files).

An attacker can craft a malicious URL with file paths and the streamlit server would process that URL and return the contents of that file.  ### Patches On July 27th at 2:20PM PST we rolled out a patch in release 1.11.1. This patch ensures that any file operations are restricted only to the custom component directory and cannot traverse outside of that. We strongly recommend users upgrade to v1.11.1 as soon as possible. We have notified the Streamlit community and popular hosting providers about this issue so they can patch quickly. As a precautionary measure, we are also upgrading all users on Streamlit Cloud wherever possible. We continue to check other occurrences of this vulnerability and monitor potential exploits wherever we can.  Finally, as a general security practice, we recommend users review custom components for any malicious code before using them in their apps. Following security best practices such as running web servers with low privileges, firewalls, etc. for hosting your apps, helps in mitigating the severity of such exploits.  ### Workarounds None.  ### References * https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRzF9K6gwv9KnQz---1pt0SdHMVt-CHuKMmdTH1uct7xPcK7vToP4FvYdI84aO6rGfCmrBSaViri0Nd/pub  ### For more information If you have any questions or comments about this advisory: * Email us at [security@streamlit.io](mailto:security@streamlit.io) ",CVE-2022-35918,v6:3429751123e94645bdac5ac1929acf22,1,8,"{""GitHubAdvisories"":{""Url"":""https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/security/advisories/GHSA-v4hr-4jpx-56gc""},""WhiteSource"":{""Url"":""https://vuln.whitesourcesoftware.com/vulnerability/CVE-2022-35918""}}",2022-08-03 01:58:50.9269570

3,1942,97624,7536033,"### Impact _What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_  The PGJDBC implementation of the `java.sql.ResultRow.refreshRow()` method is not performing escaping of column names so a malicious column name that contains a statement terminator, e.g. `;`, could lead to SQL injection. This could lead to executing additional SQL commands as the application's JDBC user.  User applications that do not invoke the `ResultSet.refreshRow()` method are not impacted.  User application that do invoke that method are impacted if the underlying database that they are querying via their JDBC application may be under the control of an attacker. The attack requires the attacker to trick the user into executing SQL against a table name who's column names would contain the malicious SQL and subsequently invoke the `refreshRow()` method on the ResultSet.  For example:  ```sql CREATE TABLE refresh_row_example (   id     int PRIMARY KEY,   ""1 FROM refresh_row_example; SELECT pg_sleep(10); SELECT * "" int ); ```  This example has a table with two columns. The name of the second column is crafted to contain a statement terminator followed by additional SQL. Invoking the `ResultSet.refreshRow()` on a ResultSet that queried this table, e.g. `SELECT * FROM refresh_row`, would cause the additional SQL commands such as the `SELECT pg_sleep(10)` invocation to be executed.  As the multi statement command would contain multiple results, it would not be possible for the attacker to get data directly out of this approach as the `ResultSet.refreshRow()` method would throw an exception. However, the attacker could execute any arbitrary SQL including inserting the data into another table that could then be read or any other DML / DDL statement.  Note that the application's JDBC user and the schema owner need not be the same. A JDBC application that executes as a privileged user querying database schemas owned by potentially malicious less-privileged users would be vulnerable.

This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`. This logic was insufficient when file paths contained repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would only strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute file path with repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. `///home/user/.bashrc`) would still resolve to an absolute path, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.2, 4.4.14, 5.0.6 and 6.1.1. Users may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom `onentry` method which sanitizes the `entry.path` or a `filter` method which removes entries with absolute paths.

3,1969,172811,7911278,"OpenSSL supports creating a custom cipher via the legacy EVP_CIPHER_meth_new() function and associated function calls. This function was deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0 and application authors are instead encouraged to use the new provider mechanism in order to implement custom ciphers. OpenSSL versions 3.0.0 to 3.0.5 incorrectly handle legacy custom ciphers passed to the EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() and EVP_CipherInit_ex2() functions (as well as other similarly named encryption and decryption initialisation functions). Instead of using the custom cipher directly it incorrectly tries to fetch an equivalent cipher from the available providers. An equivalent cipher is found based on the NID passed to EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(). This NID is supposed to represent the unique NID for a given cipher. However it is possible for an application to incorrectly pass NID_undef as this value in the call to EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(). When NID_undef is used in this way the OpenSSL encryption/decryption initialisation function will match the NULL cipher as being equivalent and will fetch this from the available providers. This will succeed if the default provider has been loaded (or if a third party provider has been loaded that offers this cipher). Using the NULL cipher means that the plaintext is emitted as the ciphertext. Applications are only affected by this issue if they call EVP_CIPHER_meth_new() using NID_undef and subsequently use it in a call to an encryption/decryption initialisation function.

3,2019,191316,7600735,OpenSSL 1.1.1 introduced a rewritten random number generator (RNG). This was intended to include protection in the event of a fork() system call in order to ensure that the parent and child processes did not share the same RNG state. However this protection was not being used in the default case. A partial mitigation for this issue is that the output from a high precision timer is mixed into the RNG state so the likelihood of a parent and child process sharing state is significantly reduced. If an application already calls OPENSSL_init_crypto() explicitly using OPENSSL_INIT_ATFORK then this problem does not occur at all.

3,2019,191316,7600732,"The X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different types of names. One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the ""-crl_download"" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue.

3,2019,191316,7600719,"OpenSSL 1.0.2 supports SSLv2. If a client attempts to negotiate SSLv2 with a server that is configured to support both SSLv2 and more recent SSL and TLS versions then a check is made for a version rollback attack when unpadding an RSA signature. Clients that support SSL or TLS versions greater than SSLv2 are supposed to use a special form of padding. A server that supports greater than SSLv2 is supposed to reject connection attempts from a client where this special form of padding is present, because this indicates that a version rollback has occurred (i.e. both client and server support greater than SSLv2, and yet this is the version that is being requested). The implementation of this padding check inverted the logic so that the connection attempt is accepted if the padding is present, and rejected if it is absent. This means that such as server will accept a connection if a version rollback attack has occurred. Further the server will erroneously reject a connection if a normal SSLv2 connection attempt is made. Only OpenSSL 1.0.2 servers from version 1.0.2s to 1.0.2x are affected by this issue. In order to be vulnerable a 1.0.2 server must: 1) have configured SSLv2 support at compile time (this is off by default), 2) have configured SSLv2 support at runtime (this is off by default), 3) have configured SSLv2 ciphersuites (these are not in the default ciphersuite list) OpenSSL 1.1.1 does not have SSLv2 support and therefore is not vulnerable to this issue. The underlying error is in the implementation of the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function. This also affects the RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode used by various other functions. Although 1.1.1 does not support SSLv2 the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function still exists, as does the RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode. Applications that directly call that function or use that padding mode will encounter this issue. However since there is no support for the SSLv2 protocol in 1.1.1 this is considered a bug and not a security issue in that version.

3,2032,141260,7269115,"### Impact The module `AccessControl` defines security policies for Python code used in restricted code within Zope applications. Restricted code is any code that resides in Zope's object database, such as the contents of `Script (Python)` objects.   The policies defined in `AccessControl` severely restrict access to Python modules and only exempt a few that are deemed safe, such as Python's `string` module. However, full access to the `string` module also allows access to the class `Formatter`, which can be overridden and extended within `Script (Python)` in a way that provides access to other unsafe Python libraries. Those unsafe Python libraries can be used for remote code execution.  By default, you need to have the admin-level Zope ""Manager"" role to add or edit `Script (Python)` objects through the web. Only sites that allow untrusted users to add/edit these scripts through the web - which would be a very unusual configuration to begin with - are at risk.  ### Patches The problem has been fixed in AccessControl 4.3 and 5.2. Only AccessControl versions 4 and 5 are vulnerable, and only on Python 3, not Python 2.7.  ### Workarounds A site administrator can restrict adding/editing `Script (Python)` objects through the web using the standard Zope user/role permission mechanisms. Untrusted users should not be assigned the Zope Manager role and adding/editing these scripts through the web should be restricted to trusted users only. This is the default configuration in Zope.  ### For more information If you have any questions or comments about this advisory: * Open an issue in the [AccessControl issue tracker](https://github.com/zopefoundation/AccessControl/issues) * Email us at [security@plone.org](mailto:security@plone.org) ",CVE-2021-32807,v6:f30a80ca928745e78ba9c78f30b57100,1,8,"{""GitHubAdvisories"":{""Url"":""https://github.com/zopefoundation/AccessControl/security/advisories/GHSA-qcx9-j53g-ccgf""},""WhiteSource"":{""Url"":""https://vuln.whitesourcesoftware.com/vulnerability/CVE-2021-32807""}}",2022-06-10 11:11:29.8302326

3,2037,132527,5238036,"### Impact  FastAPI versions lower than `0.65.2` that used cookies for authentication in path operations that received JSON payloads sent by browsers were vulnerable to a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack.  In versions lower than `0.65.2`, FastAPI would try to read the request payload as JSON even if the `content-type` header sent was not set to `application/json` or a compatible JSON media type (e.g. `application/geo+json`).  So, a request with a content type of `text/plain` containing JSON data would be accepted and the JSON data would be extracted.  But requests with content type `text/plain` are exempt from [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) preflights, for being considered [Simple requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#simple_requests). So, the browser would execute them right away including cookies, and the text content could be a JSON string that would be parsed and accepted by the FastAPI application.  ### Patches  This is fixed in FastAPI `0.65.2`.  The request data is now parsed as JSON only if the `content-type` header is `application/json` or another JSON compatible media type like `application/geo+json`.  ### Workarounds  It's best to upgrade to the latest FastAPI.

This could enable an attacker to decrypt confidential messages or gain authorized access to an account belonging to the victim. We recommend replacing any RSA keys that were generated using keypair version 1.0.3 or earlier.  ## Fix  * The [bug](https://github.com/juliangruber/keypair/blob/87c62f255baa12c1ec4f98a91600f82af80be6db/index.js#L1008) in the pseudo-random number generator is fixed in commit [`9596418`](https://github.com/juliangruber/keypair/commit/9596418d3363d3e757676c0b6a8f2d35a9d1cb18). * If the crypto module is available, it is used instead of the pseudo-random number generator.

3,2060,179022,8250813,"### Description  When using the non-default ""fallback"" crypto back-end, ECC operations in `node-jose` can trigger a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition, due to a possible infinite loop in an internal calculation.  For some ECC operations, this condition is triggered randomly; for others, it can be triggered by malicious input.  #### Technical summary  The JOSE logic implemented by `node-jose` usually relies on an external cryptographic library for the underlying cryptographic primitives that JOSE operations require.  When WebCrypto or the Node `crypto` module are available, they are used.  When neither of these libraries is available, `node-jose` includes its own ""fallback"" implementations of some algorithms based on `node-forge`, in particular implementations of ECDH and ECDSA.   A various points, these algorithm implementations need to compute to the X coordinate of an elliptic curve point.  This is done by calling the `getX()` method of the object representing the point, which is an alias of the function `pointFpGetX()` in `lib/deps/ecc/math.js`.  Computing the X coordinate from the form in which the point is stored requires computing the modular inverse of the Z coordinate, using the `modInverse` function from the `jsbn` library (e.g., `this.z.modInverse(this.curve.p)`).  The output of this function call is multiplied by another value before being reduced with the `barrettReduce()` function.  The root cause of this issue is that the `jsbn` `modInverse` function sometimes returns negative results.  These results are correct in that they are equivalent mod the relevant modulus, but can be problematic for functions that expect modular operations to always return positive results (in the range `[0, p)`, where `p` is the modulus).  In particular, while the Barrett reduction algorithm in general can handle negative inputs, the implementation in `node-jose` explicitly does not. Therefore, while the negative value that is returned by `modInverse()` is mathematically correct, it leads to an error in `barrettReduce()` ca",CVE-2023-25653,v6:70a1c80b3ca44066b811fe7322da6010,2,2,"{""GitHubAdvisories"":{""Url"":""https://github.com/cisco/node-jose/security/advisories/GHSA-5h4j-qrvg-9xhw""},""WhiteSource"":{""Url"":""https://vuln.whitesourcesoftware.com/vulnerability/CVE-2023-25653""}}",2023-02-17 02:57:21.3974374

After calling `png::CommonInitDecode(..., &decode)`, the `decode` value contains allocated buffers which can only be freed by calling `png::CommonFreeDecode(&decode)`.

3,127046,145344,7240354,"### Impact  Arbitrary File Creation, Arbitrary File Overwrite, Arbitrary Code Execution  `@npmcli/arborist`, the library that calculates dependency trees and manages the `node_modules` folder hierarchy for the npm command line interface, aims to guarantee that package dependency contracts will be met, and the extraction of package contents will always be performed into the expected folder.  This is, in part, accomplished by resolving dependency specifiers defined in `package.json` manifests for dependencies with a specific name, and nesting folders to resolve conflicting dependencies.  When multiple dependencies differ only in the case of their name, Arborist's internal data structure saw them as separate items that could coexist within the same level in the `node_modules` hierarchy.  However, on case-insensitive file systems (such as macOS and Windows), this is not the case.  Combined with a symlink dependency such as `file:/some/path`, this allowed an attacker to create a situation in which arbitrary contents could be written to any location on the filesystem.  For example, a package `pwn-a` could define a dependency in their `package.json` file such as `""foo"": ""file:/some/path""`.  Another package, `pwn-b` could define a dependency such as `FOO: ""file:foo.tgz""`.  On case-insensitive file systems, if `pwn-a` was installed, and then `pwn-b` was installed afterwards, the contents of `foo.tgz` would be written to `/some/path`, and any existing contents of `/some/path` would be removed.  Anyone using npm v7.20.6 or earlier on a case-insensitive filesystem is potentially affected.  ### Patches  2.8.2 (included in npm v7.20.7 and above)  ### Fix and Caveats  There are two parts to the fix:  1. Immediately prior to extraction, if the target folder is not a directory, it is moved aside.  (If the installation fails, filesystem entries moved aside in this manner are moved back as part of the rollback process.) 2. The `children` map that represents child nodes in the tree is replaced with a case-insensitive map object, suc",CVE-2021-39134,v6:403f2e5643544f1aaefd79f629631b64,2,2,"{""GitHubAdvisories"":{""Url"":""https://github.com/npm/arborist/security/advisories/GHSA-2h3h-q99f-3fhc""},""WhiteSource"":{""Url"":""https://vuln.whitesourcesoftware.com/vulnerability/CVE-2021-39134""}}",2022-05-26 03:08:58.9354252

This is accomplished by extracting package contents into a project's `node_modules` folder.  If the `node_modules` folder of the root project or any of its dependencies is somehow replaced with a symbolic link, it could allow Arborist to write package dependencies to any arbitrary location on the file system.  Note that symbolic links contained within package artifact contents are filtered out, so another means of creating a `node_modules` symbolic link would have to be employed.  1. A `preinstall` script could replace `node_modules` with a symlink.  (This is prevented by using `--ignore-scripts`.) 2. An attacker could supply the target with a git repository, instructing them to run `npm install --ignore-scripts` in the root.  This may be successful, because `npm install --ignore-scripts` is typically not capable of making changes outside of the project directory, so it may be deemed safe.  ### Patches  2.8.2 (included in npm v7.20.7 and above)  ### Workarounds  Do not run `npm install` on untrusted codebases, without first ensuring that the `node_modules` directory in the project is not a symbolic link.  ### Fix  Prior to extracting any package contents, the `node_modules` folder into which it is extracted is verified to be a real directory.  If it is not, then it is removed.  Caveat: if you are currently relying on creating a symbolic link to the `node_modules` folder in order to share dependencies between projects, then that will no longer be possible.  Please use the `npm link` command, explicit `file:...` dependencies, and/or `workspaces` to share dependencies in a development environment.",CVE-2021-39135,v6:c08c8251e8b240eaa64283d72e2edb0a,2,2,"{""GitHubAdvisories"":{""Url"":""https://github.com/npm/arborist/security/advisories/GHSA-gmw6-94gg-2rc2""},""WhiteSource"":{""Url"":""https://vuln.whitesourcesoftware.com/vulnerability/CVE-2021-39135""}}",2022-05-26 03:08:58.9354252

3,136263,178565,6851189,"regex is an implementation of regular expressions for the Rust language. The regex crate features built-in mitigations to prevent denial of service attacks caused by untrusted regexes, or untrusted input matched by trusted regexes. Those (tunable) mitigations already provide sane defaults to prevent attacks. This guarantee is documented and it's considered part of the crate's API. Unfortunately a bug was discovered in the mitigations designed to prevent untrusted regexes to take an arbitrary amount of time during parsing, and it's possible to craft regexes that bypass such mitigations. This makes it possible to perform denial of service attacks by sending specially crafted regexes to services accepting user-controlled, untrusted regexes. All versions of the regex crate before or equal to 1.5.4 are affected by this issue. The fix is include starting from regex 1.5.5. All users accepting user-controlled regexes are recommended to upgrade immediately to the latest version of the regex crate. Unfortunately there is no fixed set of problematic regexes, as there are practically infinite regexes that could be crafted to exploit this vulnerability. Because of this, it us not recommend to deny known problematic regexes.",CVE-2022-24713,v6:45d6f6a686f8494dbf7c0358338cca9f,1,13,"{""Debian"":{""Url"":""https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-24713""}}",2022-04-07 03:46:41.3900533

3,136263,191963,7968037,"# Description  In versions previous to 2.40.0, Azure CLI contains a vulnerability for potential code injection. Critical scenarios are where a hosting machine runs an Azure CLI command where parameter values have been provided by an external source.   For example: Application X is a web application with a feature that allows users to create Secrets in an Azure KeyVault. Instead of constructing API calls based on user input, Application X uses Azure CLI commands to create the secrets. Application X has input fields presented to the user and the Azure CLI command parameter values are filled based on the user input fields. This input, when formed correctly, could potentially be run as system commands. Below is an example of the resulting Azure CLI command run on the web app's hosting machine.   ```bash az keyvault secret set --vault-name SomeVault --name foobar --value ""abc123|whoami"" ```  The above command could potentially run the `whoami` command on the hosting machine.  Interactive, in-terminal use and automation/pipeline scenarios have not been identified as critical risk scenarios.  ## Code injection prerequisites  The vulnerability is only applicable when the Azure CLI command is run on a Windows machine **_and_** with any version of PowerShell **_and_**when the parameter value contains the `&` or `|` symbols. If any of these prerequisites are not met, this vulnerability is not applicable.  ### 1. The command has to be run on Windows  The Azure CLI has an entry script that, when run on Windows, calls cmd.exe to then call Python. This leads into the next prerequisite.  ### 2. The command has to be executed by PowerShell.  PowerShell has input parsing designs that strip out the quotation marks of input with the expectation that it will be taken as a string. When used in a PowerShell environment, the command is input like the above command. However, when it passes through PowerShell into cmd.exe, it looks like the following.   ```powershell az keyvault secret set --vault-name SomeVault --name foobar --value abc1",CVE-2022-39327,v6:f7323ff09daf47a8bbfba16a69f3bba5,2,8,"{""GitHubAdvisories"":{""Url"":""https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/security/advisories/GHSA-47xc-9rr2-q7p4""},""WhiteSource"":{""Url"":""https://vuln.whitesourcesoftware.com/vulnerability/CVE-2022-39327""}}",2022-11-12 03:43:24.3673827

This behavior is counter to the security policy followed by Nokogiri maintainers, which is to treat all input as **untrusted** by default whenever possible.  Please note that this security fix was pushed into a new minor version, 1.11.x, rather than a patch release to the 1.10.x branch, because it is a breaking change for some schemas and the risk was assessed to be ""Low Severity"".   ### Affected Versions  Nokogiri `<= 1.10.10` as well as prereleases `1.11.0.rc1`, `1.11.0.rc2`, and `1.11.0.rc3`   ### Mitigation  There are no known workarounds for affected versions. Upgrade to Nokogiri `1.11.0.rc4` or later.  If, after upgrading to `1.11.0.rc4` or later, you wish to re-enable network access for resolution of external resources (i.e., return to the previous behavior):  1. Ensure the input is trusted. Do not enable this option for untrusted input. 2. When invoking the `Nokogiri::XML::Schema` constructor, pass as the second parameter an instance of `Nokogiri::XML::ParseOptions` with the `NONET` flag turned off.  So if your previous code was:  ``` ruby # in v1.11.0.rc3 and earlier, this call allows resources to be accessed over the network # but in v1.11.0.rc4 and later, this call will disallow network access for external resources schema = Nokogiri::XML::Schema.new(schema)  # in v1.11.0.rc4 and later, the following is equivalent to the code above # (the second parameter is optional, and this demonstrates its default value) schema = Nokogiri::XML::Schema.new(schema, Nokogiri::XML::ParseOptions::DEFAULT_SCHEMA) ```  Then you can add the second parameter to indicate that the input is trusted by changing it to:  ``` r",CVE-2020-26247,v6:138ff0b5fc6b406582ba299d164e83a1,1,6,"{""GitHubAdvisories"":{""Url"":""https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/security/advisories/GHSA-vr8q-g5c7-m54m""},""WhiteSource"":{""Url"":""https://vuln.whitesourcesoftware.com/vulnerability/CVE-2020-26247""}}",2022-11-29 08:50:26.6281645

3,152426,177144,6195901,"Requests to the `ConcatServlet` and `WelcomeFilter` are able to access protected resources within the `WEB-INF` directory. For example a request to the `ConcatServlet` with a URI of `/concat?/%2557EB-INF/web.xml` can retrieve the web.xml file. This can reveal sensitive information regarding the implementation of a web application.  This occurs because both `ConcatServlet` and `WelcomeFilter` decode the supplied path to verify it is not within the `WEB-INF` or `META-INF` directories. It then uses this decoded path to call `RequestDispatcher` which will also do decoding of the path. This double decoding allows paths with a doubly encoded `WEB-INF` to bypass this security check.  ### Impact This affects all versions of `ConcatServlet` and `WelcomeFilter` in versions before 9.4.41, 10.0.3 and 11.0.3.  ### Workarounds  If you cannot update to the latest version of Jetty, you can instead deploy your own version of the [`ConcatServlet`](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/blob/4204526d2fdad355e233f6bf18a44bfe028ee00b/jetty-servlets/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/servlets/ConcatServlet.java) and/or the [`WelcomeFilter`](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/blob/4204526d2fdad355e233f6bf18a44bfe028ee00b/jetty-servlets/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/servlets/WelcomeFilter.java) by using the code from the latest version of Jetty.

3,159106,184651,7704387,"jsoup may incorrectly sanitize HTML including `javascript:` URL expressions, which could allow cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks when a reader subsequently clicks that link. If the non-default `SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks` option is enabled, HTML including `javascript:` URLs that have been crafted with control characters will not be sanitized. If the site that this HTML is published on does not set a Content Security Policy, an XSS attack is then possible.  ### Impact Sites that accept input HTML from users and use jsoup to sanitize that HTML, may be vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, if they have enabled `SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks` and do not set an appropriate Content Security Policy.  ### Patches This issue is patched in jsoup 1.15.3.  Users should upgrade to this version. Additionally, as the unsanitized input may have been persisted, old content should be cleaned again using the updated version.  ### Workarounds To remediate this issue without immediately upgrading:  - disable `SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks`, which will rewrite input URLs as absolute URLs - ensure an appropriate [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) is defined. (This should be used regardless of upgrading, as a defence-in-depth best practice.)  ### Background and root cause jsoup includes a [Cleaner](https://jsoup.org/apidocs/org/jsoup/safety/Cleaner.html) component, which is designed to [sanitize input HTML](https://jsoup.org/cookbook/cleaning-html/safelist-sanitizer) against configurable safe-lists of acceptable tags, attributes, and attribute values.  This includes removing potentially malicious attributes such as `<a href=""javascript:..."">`, which may enable XSS attacks. It does this by validating URL attributes against allowed URL protocols (e.g. `http`, `https`).  However, an attacker may be able to bypass this check by embedding control characters into the href attribute value. This causes the Java URL class, which is used to resolve relative URLs to absolute URLs bef",CVE-2022-36033,v6:0907308476f04da9a311f82909e73b1d,1,3,"{""GitHubAdvisories"":{""Url"":""https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/security/advisories/GHSA-gp7f-rwcx-9369""},""WhiteSource"":{""Url"":""https://vuln.whitesourcesoftware.com/vulnerability/CVE-2022-36033""}}",2022-09-30 02:03:47.8015454

This effect may support a denial of service attack.  ### Patches _Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_ Users should upgrade to jsoup 1.14.2  ### Workarounds _Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_ Users may rate limit input parsing. Users should limit the size of inputs based on system resources. Users should implement thread watchdogs to cap and timeout parse runtimes.

3,161654,185959,6229082,"Internally libssl in OpenSSL calls X509_verify_cert() on the client side to verify a certificate supplied by a server. That function may return a negative return value to indicate an internal error (for example out of memory). Such a negative return value is mishandled by OpenSSL and will cause an IO function (such as SSL_connect() or SSL_do_handshake()) to not indicate success and a subsequent call to SSL_get_error() to return the value SSL_ERROR_WANT_RETRY_VERIFY. This return value is only supposed to be returned by OpenSSL if the application has previously called SSL_CTX_set_cert_verify_callback(). Since most applications do not do this the SSL_ERROR_WANT_RETRY_VERIFY return value from SSL_get_error() will be totally unexpected and applications may not behave correctly as a result. The exact behaviour will depend on the application but it could result in crashes, infinite loops or other similar incorrect responses. This issue is made more serious in combination with a separate bug in OpenSSL 3.0 that will cause X509_verify_cert() to indicate an internal error when processing a certificate chain. This will occur where a certificate does not include the Subject Alternative Name extension but where a Certificate Authority has enforced name constraints.

3,164730,198316,7543052,"The X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different types of names. One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the ""-crl_download"" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME.

3,164730,198316,7543056,"ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own ""d2i"" functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the ""data"" and ""length"" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the ""data"" field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such ",CVE-2021-3712,v6:56eb1f216ed84d1e89a0cf865796de70,1,13,"{""Debian"":{""Url"":""https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3712""}}",2022-08-11 09:58:15.3049677

The application can then allocate a sufficiently sized buffer and call EVP_PKEY_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value for the ""out"" parameter. A bug in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code means that the calculation of the buffer size required to hold the plaintext returned by the first call to EVP_PKEY_decrypt() can be smaller than the actual size required by the second call.

This substitution attack can occur only if the validating application also have access to the private key, normally used to sign the tokens, available during validation of the received JWT. The significance of this attacks depends on the use of the token, it may lead to authentication bypass or authorization bypass (respectively if claims are used to authenticate or authorize certain actions), because the attacker has full control of the data placed in the JWE and can inject any desired claim value.  Several mitigating factors exist that can protect applications from this issue: - If the private key corresponding to the public key used to encrypt the JWE is not available to the application an exception will be raised. - If the JWK is specified with the 'use' parameter set to 'sig' (as expected for keys used only for signing/verification) an exception will be raised. - If the JWK is specified with the 'key_ops' parameter set and it does not include the 'decrypt' operation an exception will be raised. - Applications may check the token type before validation, in this case they would fail to detect an expected JWS  Normally, signing and validation are done by different applications, so this scenario should be unlikely.

3,167420,193662,6809267,"### Impact Tink's Java version before 1.5 under some circumstances allowed attackers to change the key ID part of the ciphertext, resulting in the attacker creating a second ciphertext that will decrypt to the same plaintext. This can be a problem in particular in the case of encrypting with a deterministic AEAD with a single key, and relying on the fact that there is only a single valid ciphertext per plaintext.  No loss of confidentiality or loss of plaintext integrity occurs due to this problem, only ciphertext integrity is compromised.  ### Patches The issue was fixed in this [pull request](https://github.com/google/tink/commit/93d839a5865b9d950dffdc9d0bc99b71280a8899).  ### Workarounds The only workaround is to backport the fixing [pull request](https://github.com/google/tink/commit/93d839a5865b9d950dffdc9d0bc99b71280a8899).  ### Details Tink uses the first five bytes of a ciphertext for a version byte and a four byte key ID. Since each key has a well defined prefix, this extends non-malleability properties (but technically not indistinguishability). However, in the Java version this prefix lookup used a hash map indexed by unicode strings instead of the byte array, which means that invalid Unicode characters would be [replaced by U+FFFD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8#Invalid_sequences_and_error_handling) by the [Java API's default behavior](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#String(byte[],%20java.nio.charset.Charset)). This means several different values for the five bytes would result in the same hash table key, which allows an attacker to exchange one invalid byte sequence for another, creating a mutated ciphertext that still decrypts (to the same plaintext).  ### Acknowledgements We'd like to thank Peter Esbensen for finding this issue and raising it internally.  ### For more information If you have any questions or comments about this advisory: * Open an issue in [Tink](https://github.com/google/tink/issues)",CVE-2020-8929,v6:949c7b6089bc4d58874befde1af328a6,0,3,"{""GitHubAdvisories"":{""Url"":""https://github.com/google/tink/security/advisories/GHSA-g5vf-v6wf-7w2r""},""WhiteSource"":{""Url"":""https://vuln.whitesourcesoftware.com/vulnerability/CVE-2020-8929""}}",2022-03-23 21:09:57.0369425

What versions should users upgrade to?_ Users should upgrade to `jupyter_core>=4.11.2`.  ### Workarounds _Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_ No  ### References _Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_ Similar advisory in [IPython](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pq7m-3gw7-gq5x)  ",CVE-2022-39286,v6:ae17fda756cb453b8cc41e9c79debbf1,2,8,"{""GitHubAdvisories"":{""Url"":""https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_core/security/advisories/GHSA-m678-f26j-3hrp""},""WhiteSource"":{""Url"":""https://vuln.whitesourcesoftware.com/vulnerability/CVE-2022-39286""}}",2023-01-07 00:35:40.7918950
3,168232,204223,8212053,"### Impact _What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_  Authenticated requests to the notebook server with `ContentsManager.allow_hidden = False` only prevented listing the contents of hidden directories, not accessing individual hidden files or files in hidden directories (i.e. hidden files were 'hidden' but not 'inaccessible'). This could lead to notebook configurations allowing authenticated access to files that may reasonably be expected to be disallowed.  Because fully authenticated requests are required, this is of relatively low impact. But if a server's root directory contains sensitive files whose only protection from the server is being hidden (e.g. `~/.ssh` while serving $HOME), then any authenticated requests could access files if their names are guessable. Such contexts also necessarily have full access to the server and therefore execution permissions, which also generally grants access to all the same files. So this does not generally result in any privilege escalation or increase in information access, only an additional, unintended _means_ by which the files could be accessed.  ### Patches _Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_  notebook 6.4.12  ### Workarounds _Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_  - Do not run the notebook server in a directory with hidden files, use subdirectories - Use a custom ContentsManager with additional checks for `self.is_hidden(path)` prior to completing actions  ### References _Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_  ### For more information If you have any questions or comments about this advisory: * Open an issue in [example link to repo](http://example.com) * Email us at [example email address](mailto:example@example.com) ",CVE-2022-29238,v6:0d8df40fafb446edb9908442861bdb0e,1,8,"{""GitHubAdvisories"":{""Url"":""https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/security/advisories/GHSA-v7vq-3x77-87vg""},""WhiteSource"":{""Url"":""https://vuln.whitesourcesoftware.com/vulnerability/CVE-2022-29238""}}",2023-01-07 00:35:40.7918950

3,168232,204225,8211191,"### Impact The vulnerability is present in [`PunktSentenceTokenizer`](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.tokenize.punkt.html#nltk.tokenize.punkt.PunktSentenceTokenizer), [`sent_tokenize`](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.tokenize.html#nltk.tokenize.sent_tokenize)  and [`word_tokenize`](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.tokenize.html#nltk.tokenize.word_tokenize). Any users of this class, or these two functions, are vulnerable to a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack.  In short, a specifically crafted long input to any of these vulnerable functions will cause them to take a significant amount of execution time. The effect of this vulnerability is noticeable with the following example: ```python from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize  n = 8 for length in [10**i for i in range(2, n)]:     # Prepare a malicious input     text = ""a"" * length     start_t = time.time()     # Call `word_tokenize` and naively measure the execution time     word_tokenize(text)     print(f""A length of {length:<{n}} takes {time.time() - start_t:.4f}s"") ``` Which gave the following output during testing: ```python A length of 100      takes 0.0060s A length of 1000     takes 0.0060s A length of 10000    takes 0.6320s A length of 100000   takes 56.3322s ... ``` I canceled the execution of the program after running it for several hours.  If your program relies on any of the vulnerable functions for tokenizing unpredictable user input, then we would strongly recommend upgrading to a version of NLTK without the vulnerability, or applying the workaround described below.  ### Patches The problem has been patched in NLTK 3.6.6. After the fix, running the above program gives the following result: ```python A length of 100      takes 0.0070s A length of 1000     takes 0.0010s A length of 10000    takes 0.0060s A length of 100000   takes 0.0400s A length of 1000000  takes 0.3520s A length of 10000000 takes 3.4641s ``` This output shows a linear relationship in execution time versus input length, which is desirable for regular expressions.
